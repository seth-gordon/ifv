<p>WASHINGTON, April 1 (<abbr title="April Fool's Press">AFP</abbr>)&#8212;After years of tussling with Congress over establishing an <code>.xxx</code> top-level domain for pornography, the <a href="http://www.icann.org/">International Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers</a> (ICANN) has unveiled a compromise: a new top-level domain encompassing not only pornography, but any Internet content deemed &#8220;not safe for work&#8221;.</p>
	<p>While everyone has their own opinion about how to define pornography, the new <code>.nsfw</code> domain will be governed by simple and objective standards. Any employer who believes that the content available on a Web site is not safe for work may file a complaint with a special ICANN committee, whose members are nominated by the <a href="http://www.uschamber.com/">United States Chamber of Commerce</a>. The committee has the authority to reassign any IP address to a new domain in the <code>.nsfw</code> hierarchy. Employers can filter access to all these domains, and be assured that their workers are not endangering themselves on the Internet. Consumers will be allowed to access <code>.nsfw</code> domains from home, of course, but if they have trouble reaching them, they will not be able to get help from their Internet service providers, since the ISP&#8217;s technical-support workers will have their access filtered.</p>
	<p>If the owner of a site believes that he or she was put in the <code>.nsfw</code> domain by mistake, he or she can petition the NSFW Board of Appeal, which meets to hear such disputes in the bar of the Raffles Hotel, in Singapore, from 10:00&nbsp;a.m. to noon every February 29.</p>
	<p>A spokesperson for the <a href="http://www.eff.nsfw">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> could not be reached for comment.</p>
