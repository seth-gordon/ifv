<p>According to <a href="http://www.democracycorps.com/wp-content/files/dcor062210fq6.web_.pdf">a recent poll</a> [PDF] with a three-point margin of error:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>55%</strong> of likely voters think think that the phrase “a socialist” describes President Obama “very well” or “well”.</li>
		<li><strong>51%</strong> of likely voters disapprove of how President Obama is doing his job. When asked why they disapproved, only <strong>8%</strong> of those who disapproved described him as “socialist” or “communist”.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>I wonder what proportion of voters both consider Obama a socialist <em>and approve of his job performance</em>.</p>
