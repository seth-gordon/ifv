<p>Charles Dodgson <a href="http://thelookingglass.blogspot.com/2003_08_17_thelookingglass_archive.html#106155927533038358">excerpts</a> a recent NPR program on the situation in Kandahar. Our good friends in Afghanistan, the provincial warlords, are making sure that we don&#8217;t run out of Taliban to fight with: <blockquote>It is absolutely clear in Kandahar that these so-called US allies are in fact allowing the extremist elements back in from Pakistan. It&#8217;s like a man flying two kites. They&#8217;re flying the American kite and the extremist kite at the same time. And they are just tweaking the strings enough of each side to keep them both in the air.</blockquote></p>
