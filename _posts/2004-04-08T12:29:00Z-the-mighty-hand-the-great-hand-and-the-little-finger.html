<p>The Haggadah contains this well-known paragraph: <blockquote>Rabbi Yose the Galilean said: How do we know that the Egyptians &#8230; were struck by fifty plagues at the sea? In Egypt, this is what it says: &#8220;And the magicians said to Pharoah, &#8216;this is the <em>finger</em> of God&#8217;&#8221; (Exodus 8:15), and at the sea, this is what it says: &#8220;And Israel saw the great <em>hand</em> that God used against Egypt, and the nation was in awe of the Eternal, and they believed in the Eternal and in his servant Moses&#8221; (Exodus 14:31).</blockquote> When we were reading that on Tuesday night, one of our Seder guests said, hey, wait a second! A few paragraphs back, <em>another</em> plague was compared to a hand, not a finger: <blockquote><i>With a mighty hand:</i> This refers to the plague. As Scripture says: Behold, the <em>hand</em> of the Eternal will be against the flocks that are in the fields, against the horses, the donkeys, the camels, the cattle and the sheep, a very heavy plague.</blockquote> <p>(OK, all together now: &#8220;Dang, I&#8217;ve been reading the Haggadah for all these years, and I never noticed that! I&#8217;ve got to switch to grape juice for the first cup.&#8221;)</p> <p>Fortunately for us, the Ritva asked the same question, answering it thusly:</p> <blockquote>&#8230;[T]he written verses here are only a support, and the Kabbalah is the fundamental thing. And it is known that &#8220;His burning anger&#8221; is nothing but the little finger of the hand, and this is also the strong hand, but &#8220;the great hand&#8221; has five of the small fingers, and this is a mystery.</blockquote> Our guest believed that the Ritva is alluding to a statement in the Mechilta, that at the crossing of the Red Sea, even the Jewish serving women saw a greater revelation of God&#8217;s presence than Ezekiel saw in his prophecy.</p>
