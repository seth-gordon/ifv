<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/21/world/asia/21china.html?hp=&amp;pagewanted=all">This <span class="caps">NYT</span> article</a> was, alas, written as a human-interest story, rather than as a geek-interest story. The author explains that the new identity cards issued by China&#8217;s Public Security Bureau are rejecting many citizens&#8217; names because of their &#8220;obscure&#8221; characters because &#8220;[t]he bureau’s computers&#8230; are programmed to read only 32,252 of the roughly 55,000 Chinese characters&#8221;.</p>

	<p>Since 32,252 is suspiciously close to <a href="http://xkcd.com/571/">32,767</a>, I am wondering if the Bureau is stuck using an obsolete <del>31</del><ins>15</ins>-bit-wide character set. Perhaps someone from the technical press can follow up and ask the appropriate government officials: &#8220;what character set are you using?&#8221; and &#8220;why don&#8217;t you just use <a href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/unihan.html">Unicode</a>?”</p>

	<p>I should point out, in fairness, that my casual search didn&#8217;t locate the second character of Ma Cheng&#8217;s name in the Unihan database, so perhaps she would be out of luck even with a Unicode database.  Or maybe I just suck at recognizing Chinese characters.</p>
