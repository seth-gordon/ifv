<p>I have certain warm fuzzy feelings&#8212;in my reptilian hindbrain, you might say&#8212;for the original <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_%281983_miniseries%29"><em>V</em> miniseries</a>, and I figured it would be a refreshing change to watch a new TV show <em>when it is broadcast</em> instead of waiting a few years for the <span class="caps">DVD</span>s to arrive.  So I saw the first episode of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_%282009_TV_series%29">the remake</a>.</p>

	<p>Micro-mini-review: Meh.</p>

	<p>Slightly longer review with <strong>spoilers</strong>: If a bunch of hawt alien refugees from Obama&#8217;s Presidential campaign show up with their Cunning Plan to Take Over The World, I would subcontract out the Resistance Movement to Al-Qaeda before trusting the fifth-columnists who reveal themselves in the fifth act. Why on earth did Ryan gather a dozen potential resistance fighters, including at least two whom nobody could vouch for, in one place, where they could hear his infodump and then conveniently be slaughtered? If this guy really cares about saving the planet, why didn&#8217;t he spend a few minutes in the library and learn how to set up a proper <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clandestine_cell_system">cell structure</a> for passing along the same information? And did that <span class="caps">FBI</span> agent really let a member of a suspected terrorist cell inject her with an alleged anaesthetic and cut open her skin? And doesn&#8217;t Mr. Ambitious Newscaster know how to <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2098297/">grease a source</a>? And <span class="caps">WTF</span> did Reverend Young and Skeptical mean when he declared he didn&#8217;t understand how &#8220;God and aliens could live in the same universe&#8221;?</p>

	<p>I think this show is set in a universe where the Visitors really <em>are</em> the only form of intelligent life.</p>

	<p>Also, the Visitors don&#8217;t do that cool reverb thing with their voices that they did in the original series. My reptilian hindbrain is <em>so</em> disappointed.</p>
