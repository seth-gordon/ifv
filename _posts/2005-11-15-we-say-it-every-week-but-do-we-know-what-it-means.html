<p>The <i>Kiddush</i> for Friday night contains the sentence &#8220;&#1499;&#1497; &#1492;&#1493;&#1488; &#1497;&#1493;&#1501; &#1514;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492; &#1500;&#1502;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497; &#1511;&#1493;&#1491;&#1513; &#1494;&#1499;&#1512; &#1500;&#1497;&#1510;&#1497;&#1488;&#1514; &#1502;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501;&#8221;. Artscroll translates this as &#8220;For that day is the prologue to the holy convocations, a memorial of the Exodus from Egypt&#8221;. <p>I hear you scratching your head and saying, &#8220;What does Shabbat have to do with the Exodus?&#8221; Fortunately, according to the Artscroll footnote, Nachmanides had the same question, and he explained that Shabbat, representing God&#8217;s creation, is &#8220;the backdrop of the Exodus&#8221;, God&#8217;s demonstration of His ability to intervene in nature.</p> <p>However, the <a href="http://nevarech.co.il/Pages_52-53.html">Nevarech</a> bentscher translates the same sentence as &#8220;a day preceding even those sacred occasions commemorating the departure from Egypt&#8221;, which moots the whole question. All the translator did to reach that interpretation is to rearrange the parse tree a little bit&#8212;treating &#1494;&#1499;&#1512; &#1500;&#1497;&#1510;&#1497;&#1488;&#1514; &#1502;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501; as a modifier to &#1502;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497; &#1511;&#1493;&#1491;&#1513; rather than to &#1497;&#1493;&#1501;. <strike>And I don&#8217;t see anything in the phrasing or the punctuation to prove that one of these parse trees is better than the other. (<a href="http://www.lojban.org/tiki/tiki-download_wiki_attachment.php?attId=193#s3">Lojban</a> enthusiasts, please take note.)</strike> This is somewhat forced, since &#1502;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497; &#1511;&#1493;&#1491;&#1513; is plural and &#1494;&#1499;&#1512; &#1500;&#1497;&#1510;&#1497;&#1488;&#1514; &#1502;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501; is singular. Maybe the translators know a loophole in the grammar that I don&#8217;t; can you treat the &#1502;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497; as some sort of collective that takes a singular modifier?</p> <p>But every other <i>Kiddush</i> translation I&#8217;ve seen interprets the sentence the way Artscroll does. So if the <i>Nevarech</i> translation is consistent with the Hebrew text and makes more sense, why don&#8217;t any other translators parse it that way?</p></p>
