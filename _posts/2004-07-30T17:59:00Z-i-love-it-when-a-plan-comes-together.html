<p>Isn&#8217;t it convenient for the Pakistani government that they could announce <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/30/international/asia/30qaed.html?ex=1248840000&amp;en=559d08882d3b5e7d&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland">the arrest of a man on the <span class="caps">FBI</span>&#8217;s most-wanted-terrorist list</a> just in time for John Kerry&#8217;s acceptance speech, <a href="http://tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=20040719&amp;s=aaj071904">following the schedule that the Bush Administration has allegedly demanded</a>? <p>And isn&#8217;t it convenient for Osama bin Laden that the man they arrested is a Tanzanian associated with the 1998 embassy bombings, rather than, say, an Arab associated with more recent al-Qaeda activities?</p></p>
