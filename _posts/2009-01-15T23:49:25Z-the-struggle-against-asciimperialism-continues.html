<p>I learned two things about Linux this week. First, even in <span class="caps">UTF</span>-8 locales, <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/coreutils.html#fold-invocation">fold</a> thinks that any byte with a value above 127 is a space.</p>

<pre><code>$ echo &#39;superextraordinarísimo&#39; | fold -s -w 18

$ echo &#39;superextraordinarísimo&#39; | fold -s -w 18 | od -c

	<p>Second, even if you <em>can</em> solve a tricky document-recoding problem with nothing more than <a href="http://www.faqs.org/docs/abs/HTML/sedawk.html">sed and awk</a>, that doesn&#8217;t mean you <em>should</em>.</p>
