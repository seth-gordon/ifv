<p>While the Republicans considered Terry Schiavo&#8217;s life important enough to cut short President Bush&#8217;s vacation, <a href="http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/metropolitan/3084934">Sun Hudson, a six-month-old terminally ill baby, became the first infant in the US authorized to have his life support discontinued <em>against his parents&#8217; wishes</em></a>. The hospital wouldn&#8217;t even honor the mother&#8217;s invitation for the media to see the allegedly-conscious baby. The law permitting this euthanasia, <a href="http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/metropolitan/3079622">the Texas Futile Care Law</a>, was drafted after negotiations with National Right to Life, and signed by one Governor George W. Bush. <p>Of course, Schiavo&#8217;s care is being subsidized by a trust fund established by a malpractice settlement. Hudson was not so lucky.</p> <p>Liberals believe that your life belongs to yourself. Conservatives of a bygone era believed that your life belongs to God. The people who call themselves &#8220;conservative&#8221; today, it seems, believe that your life belongs to Mammon.</p> <p class="via">via <a href="http://www.markarkleiman.com/archives/schiavo_/2005/03/schiavo_hudson_and_nikolouzos.php">Mark A.
