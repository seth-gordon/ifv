<p>Remember how, in the second debate, Dubya refused to acknowledge that he had made any mistakes? He&#8217;s got his counterparts on the Democratic side, too. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/09/politics/campaign/09kerry.html?ex=1257656400&en=fe63fb55f5ba43b9&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland">According to the <cite>New York Times</cite></a>, Kerry adviser Robert Shrum (<a href="http://dynamic.ropine.com/yo/politics/election-2004/shrum.html">a gentleman discussed before on this site</a>) &#8220;suggested that there was little they could have done differently to change the result.&#8221; Shrum also complained, &#8220;The economy was not driving the news coverage.&#8221;</p> <p>The author of this <cite>Times</cite> article neglected to mention that (a)&nbsp;as a recent <cite>New Yorker</cite> article makes clear, Shrum makes economic populism the focus of <em>every</em> campaign that he manages; (b)&nbsp;Kerry&#8217;s poll numbers started rising <em>after</em> Shrum was effectively demoted and Kerry began talking more about the mess in Iraq.</p> <p>Memo to future Democratic presidential aspirants: Please, please, please don&#8217;t hire this guy!</p> <p class="via">via <a href="http://www.ndnblog.org/archives/000684.html">NDN Blog</a></p>
