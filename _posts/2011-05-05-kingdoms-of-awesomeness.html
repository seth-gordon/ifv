<p>I have been putting off reviewing N. K. Jemesin&#8217;s <a href="http://nkjemisin.com/books/the-inheritance-trilogy/the-hundred-thousand-kingdoms/"><i>The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms</i></a> ever since it came out, partly because there is just so much to say about it that I haven&#8217;t found the time to write up the review it deserves. But now that it is out in mass-market paperback <em>and</em> nominated for a Hugo <em>and</em> nominated for a Nebula <em>and</em> you can get the ebook for only $2.99, I should let you all know, at the very least: <strong>Read this book. It rocks.</strong> Consider that a placeholder for the more comprehensive review that I ought to have written a long time ago.</p>

	<p>(Oh, yeah, <a href="http://nkjemisin.com/books/the-inheritance-trilogy/the-broken-kingdoms/">the sequel</a> rocks, too.)</p>
