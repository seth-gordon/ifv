<p>My wife and I just got back from a romantic date at <a href="http://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/">Brookline Booksmith</a>, and I noticed that their staff has shelved Cecilia Tanâ€™s anthology <a href="http://www.alyson.com/9781593501587.html">Women of the Bite: Lesbian Vampire Erotica</a>, not under &#8220;Fantasy&#8221; or &#8220;Gay &amp; Lesbian&#8221;, but under &#8220;Love &amp; Relationships&#8221;.</p>

	<p>I can&#8217;t quite figure that one out.  I&#8217;m not quite sure if I want to.</p>
