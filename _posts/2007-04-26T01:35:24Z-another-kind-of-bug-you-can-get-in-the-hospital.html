<p>As I have <a href="http://dynamic.ropine.com/yesh/article/a-tough-cell">previously noted</a>, most people who use spreadsheets don&#8217;t appreciate that spreadsheets are programs, and that when you have programs, you have bugs. And when you rely on spreadsheets in the emergency room, those bugs can have <a href="http://brokenhut.livejournal.com/233310.html">severe consequences</a>:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>The patient was a 3-month old baby showing “clinical signs of meningococcal sepsis with petechiae, purpura, and shock” (whatever that might mean). The baby needed a precise concoction of twelve different drugs for treatment.</p><p>The dosages were calculated using a spreadsheet template which calculates required dose from weight, age, and so on. In a standard version of Excel it is possible to “lock&#8221; particular cells so they cannot be inadvertently edited. For example, you would lock the cell which stores the formula for the calculation, so that you can’t accidentally write over it.</p><p>Unfortunately, the software used here wasn’t the full-blown version of Excel or some functional equivalent, but something called PocketExcel. It doesn’t allow locked cells; someone tabbed into the wrong field and overwrote the calculated dose with the baby’s weight. Ouch!</p>
