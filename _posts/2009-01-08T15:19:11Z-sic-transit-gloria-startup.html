<p><a href="http://metacarta.com/">My employer</a> just laid off a bunch of people.  I, thank God and Adam Smith, did not get the axe, but there are good engineers (and sales people and so on) who are pounding the pavement now.</p>

	<p>I told a friend of mine who was laid off that despite all the bad economic news, the job market is better in IT than it is in the general economy, and better than it was after the first dot-com bubble popped. Please help prove me right; if you have any leads for software jobs in the Boston area, let me know and I will pass them along to the appropriate folks.</p>
