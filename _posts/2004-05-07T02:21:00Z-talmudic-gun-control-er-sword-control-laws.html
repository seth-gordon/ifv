<p>A quick note (because, alas, I haven&#8217;t had the time to compose anything better) on last week&#8217;s parsha: we all know about the commandment &#8220;do not put a stumbling-block before the blind&#8221; (Leviticus 19:14). The rabbis (<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 15b, cited in <i>Sefer ha-Chinuch</i> &sect;232) declare, as one implication of this law, that a Jew should not sell a weapon of war to a non-Jew, unless it&#8217;s so the non-Jew can defend us. Likewise, it is forbidden to sell these weapons to a Jew who will resell it to a non-Jew, or to a Jewish bandit. <p>What are the modern implications of this halakha? Discuss&#8230;.</p></p>
