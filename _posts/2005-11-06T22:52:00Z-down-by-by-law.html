<p>I&#8217;m on a committee to revise our synagogue by-laws. We have been asked to pay special attention to the procedure for hiring a rabbi, since our current by-laws say very little about what to do, but the whole document is up for amendment. <p>If you, Gentle Reader, belong to a synagogue (other than, ahem, <a href="http://kadimahtorasmoshe.org/">mine</a>) and can point me to a copy of its by-laws, I would appreciate it. If your shul is sufficiently down with Robert&#8217;s Rules to have standing rules of order or other by-law-like regulations, I&#8217;d like to see those, too. And if you have enough experience with lay synagogue administration to have some insights into what works and what doesn&#8217;t in a set of by-laws, that would be <em>really</em> useful.</p> <p>(If you <em>do</em> belong to my shul, you&#8217;re probably blinking and saying to yourself, &#8220;By-laws? We&#8217;re organized enough to have by-laws?&#8221;)</p> <p>adTHANKSvance.</p></p>
