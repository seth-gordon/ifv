<p>I will admit to being a complete ignoramus in military affairs&mdash;I couldn&#8217;t tell the difference between a brigade and a battalion if my life depended on it&mdash;but I can&#8217;t see how <a href="http://arkhangel.blogs.com/counterpoint/2004/08/over_the_bridge.html">this</a> is going to do any good for the recruitment of American soldiers. <p>&#8220;Hey, kids, join the Army, where your superior officers will order you cover up what may be a war crime! Not only that, but when the <abbr title="Criminal Investigation Division">CID</abbr> starts prosecuting, those officers, the guys who tell you exactly how you&#8217;re supposed to die for your country, will get immunity in exchange for snitching on <em>you</em>!&#8221;</p></p>
