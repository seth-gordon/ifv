<p>I learned a new word today: <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=onomastics">onomastics</a>, the study of proper names. <p>Since my job involves maintaining and improving massive lists of proper names (the names of geographic locations, and the names of things that might get confused with geographic locations), I guess I&#8217;m a professional onomast.</p></p>
