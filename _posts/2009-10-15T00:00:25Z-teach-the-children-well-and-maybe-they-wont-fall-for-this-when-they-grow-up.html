<p>The entrepreneurs who founded <a href="http://www.absolutebestcare.com/">Absolute Best Care</a> have come up with a brilliant business plan&#8212;or possibly a brilliant grift&#8212;and the <i>New York Times</i> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/13/nyregion/13bigcity.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=nanny&amp;st=cse">doesn&#8217;t understand it</a>.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>&#8230;To that end comes the Absolute Best Care Learning Center, scheduled to open Oct. 26. For a mere $4,000 — $2,040 if you act now — aspiring nannies who attend a seven-day course will obtain training in child care, developmental milestones, <span class="caps">CPR</span>, first aid and household management. (Five have signed up so far.)</p>
		<p>It’s worth pointing out that pediatric first aid and <span class="caps">CPR</span> courses rarely run more than a few hundred bucks, and that the textbook Absolute will be using, “Mrs. Starkey’s Nanny Manager,” is $79.95 on Amazon.com.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>But as soon as I saw the price tag, I could tell that <span class="caps">ABC</span> is not selling these classes to aspiring nannies. The overprivileged parents who were portrayed in <i>The Nanny Diaries</i> will <em>send their nannies to this school</em>, and cheerfully exchange those kilobucks for the peace of mind that comes from having a properly-educated servant.</p>

	<p>The great thing about the corporate-training biz is that as long as there are employers out there with money to burn (as a tax-deductible business expense, no less), you can set prices in the stratosphere. If Harvard Extension can charge $1,975 for a six-hour class in <a href="http://www.extension.harvard.edu/2009-10/courses/21144.jsp?caller=dce">Fundamentals of Website Development</a>, then I&#8217;m sure <span class="caps">ABC</span> will have no trouble finding enough parents in the Upper West Side to fill their classes at $2,040, or even $4,000, per seat.</p>
