<p><a href="http://www.startribune.com/local/101273159.html?page=1&amp;c=y">The City of Minneapolis will pay $165,000 to seven zombies, and their attorney</a>, to settle a civil-rights lawsuit. The seven, during a protest against &#8220;mindless&#8221; consumerism, had been &#8220;walking in a stiff, lurching fashion and carrying four bags of sound equipment to amplify music from an iPod when they were arrested by police who said they were carrying equipment that simulated &#8216;weapons of mass destruction.&#8217;&#8221; Rather than defend the police&#8217;s brain-dead judgement in Federal court, the city agreed to settle.</p>

	<p>Asked to comment on the settlement, the zombies&#8217; lawyer only croaked: &#8220;Briefs&#8230; Must&#8230; file&#8230; briefs&#8230;&#8221;</p>
