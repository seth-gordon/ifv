      The missionaries’ suntans contrasted with the rain falling
      outside Angela’s porch.  They wore raincoats with the same lemon
      color as the house’s trim, and their facial expressions reminded
      her of puppies begging for attention.  As the woman held up a
      plastic-bagged copy of <i>The Watchtower</i>, Angela rubbed
      sleep out of her eyes.  Maybe she could invite them to use the
      bathroom and get a drink of water?  Should she check with Mike
      first, or just assume that her husband had slept through the
      ringing doorbell?  As she debated with herself, she noticed that
      the man’s face was changing: his cheekbones rose, his nose
      widened, and his skin bronzed to match Angela’s own complexion.
      “Derek?” she whispered.

    <p>
      The alien winked and put one finger to his lips.

      “Come in come in.”  Angela held the door wide for them.  As they
      climbed the narrow, dimly lit staircase, she heard a door open
      on the second-floor landing.  She called up, letting adrenaline
      power her voice: “It’s OK, sweetie.  Old college friends.”
      Derek lowered the raincoat hood.  His hair curled as it
      retracted into the scalp.  The woman followed him, and Angela
      took up the rear.  “You must be Kimberly?”  Angela whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kimberly looked bashfully over her shoulder.  Her lips had
      tinted themselves an un-Christian shade of red.  “Sorry if we
      woke you.  Your phones were off.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We were up late,” Angela admitted.  “Just talking.”
    <p>
      Safely inside the apartment, Kimberly embraced Angela’s husband,
      a white man with a shaved head and a Vandyke beard.  Angela
      kissed Derek on the lips, muttered something about how awful she
      looked, and took both raincoats to the bathroom.  Between
      flushing the toilet and turning on the sink, she heard Mike’s
      question “So, honey, how’s that invasion of Earth coming
      along?”, and Kimberly’s laughter.
