<p>For once in, like, decades, I have actually watched the premiere (or at least, the US network premiere) of a TV show at the same time as the rest of the world, instead of watching it on <span class="caps">DVD</span> months or years later. So, a few quick reactions to <i>Sherlock</i>, to share with fellow fans:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>One of the amazing things about fiction is that if you have a main character who is <em>passionate</em> about something, the reader will identify with that character, even if the character is otherwise, ahem, flawed. David Tennant&#8217;s wild-eyed portrayal of <i>Doctor Who</i> was enough to draw me through the series, even though, let&#8217;s face it, most of the episodes had plot holes large enough to drive a planet through. It&#8217;s nice to see some <i>Who</i> writers use Benedict Cumberbatch&#8217;s acting skill to achieve a similar effect in a TV show that actually <em>has</em> a plot.</li>
		<li>Speaking of plot, it&#8217;s also nice to watch a mystery show on TV where I do not feel compelled to reach through the screen, grab the alleged master detective (or, worse, the writer) by the lapels, and scream <em>&#8220;You idiot!&#8221;</em></li>
		<li>The use of captions to show text messages on characters&#8217; phones is an interesting presentation technique: has anyone done this before? Also, the use of captioned &#8220;wet&#8221;, &#8220;dry&#8221;, etc., as Holmes examines the body.</li>
		<li>I really hope that &#8220;everyone assumes that Holmes and Watson are a gay couple, <span class="caps">NOT</span> <span class="caps">THAT</span> WE <span class="caps">THINK</span> <span class="caps">ANYTHING</span>&#8217;S <span class="caps">WRONG</span> <span class="caps">WITH</span> <span class="caps">THAT</span>, wink wink nudge nudge&#8221; does not become a running gag throughout the series.</li>
	</ol>
