<p>This week, learning Gemara (Pesachim 112a), I learned:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Rabbi Akiva commanded his son, Rabbi Yehoshua, seven things. &#8220;My son:</p>
		<p>	<ol>
		<li>&#8220;Don&#8217;t sit and learn in the high part of the city.</li>
		<li>&#8220;And don&#8217;t live in a city whose leaders are Torah scholars.</li>
		<li>&#8220;And don&#8217;t enter your house suddenly [i.e. without announcing your presence]; all the more so your neighbor&#8217;s house.</li>
		<li>&#8220;And don&#8217;t go without shoes on your feet.</li>
		<li>&#8220;Eat early in the summer, before it gets hot, and in the winter, before it gets cold.</li>
		<li>&#8220;And make your Sabbath like a weekday rather than depending on other people.</li>
		<li>&#8220;And be on good terms with someone who is lucky.&#8221;</li>
	</ol></p>
		<p>Rav Pappa said [regarding that lucky man], &#8220;Don&#8217;t buy from him and don&#8217;t sell to him, but rather, enter into a partnership with him.&#8221; But since Rav Shmuel bar Yitzchak said, &#8220;What is the meaning of &#8216;You have blessed the work of his hands&#8217; [Job 1:10]? Every one of Job&#8217;s dropped coins was blessed&#8221;, it&#8217;s OK to buy from him and sell to him.</p>

	<p>I asked my chevruta how his employer, <a href="http://www.shoebuy.com/">Shoebuy.com</a>, is doing. &#8220;Pretty good,&#8221; he said, &#8220;since all the Torah scholars are selling everything else they own so they can keep having shoes on their feet.&#8221; Should I buy <a href="http://www.shoebuy.com/teva-mens-sandals.htm">sandals</a> or <a href="http://www.iac.com/Our-Businesses/">stock</a>?</p>
