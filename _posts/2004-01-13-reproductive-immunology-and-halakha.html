<p>(Updated to add proper attribution.) <p>A pregnant woman&#8217;s immune system, which normally treats any unfamiliar cells as a potential threat to be attacked with overwhelming force, has to know <em>not</em> to attack the fetus inside her body. Many scientists are studying the process the immune system uses to make this distinction, especially since, as <a href="http://www.nature.com/nsu/021118/021118-9.html">this <cite>Nature</cite> article</a> points out, failure of the system may be one cause of infertility.</p> <blockquote> <p>In 1989, a young British woman had her ninth consecutive miscarriage. Her marriage broke down shortly afterwards. But within months of finding a new partner, she had conceived again and the pregnancy went without a hitch. Her daughter is now a healthy and lively nine-year-old.</p> <p>Reproductive immunologists suspect that the woman&#8217;s immune system took offence at her first choice of partner &#8212; over-reacting to tissues carrying his genes and expelling the fetuses he fathered.</p> </blockquote> <p>My wife, who pointed this article out to me, observed that this (1)&nbsp;puts an interesting spin on the Talmudic rule (which is hardly ever enforced, even in black-hat communities) that if a couple has been married for ten years and not had a child, they should get divorced; (2)&nbsp;may explain why her allergies went away while she was pregnant.</p></p>
