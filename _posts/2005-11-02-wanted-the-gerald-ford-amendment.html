<p><a href="http://www.markarkleiman.com/archives/valerie_plame_/2005/11/no_pardons.php">Mark Kleiman</a> and <a href="http://www.anonymousliberal.com/2005/11/need-for-no-pardon-pledge.html">the Anonymous Liberal</a> are asking Democrats to insist on a no-pardons pledge from President Bush. They don&#8217;t go far enough. What, after all, is a pledge from this President worth? <p>We need some <a href="http://www.discourse.net/archives/2005/09/spontaneous_generation_observed_in_nature.html">spiny jellyfish</a> to introduce a <em>constitutional amendment</em>, something like this:</p> <dl> <dt>Section 1</dt> <dd>The President may not grant any pardon until the offender to be pardoned has been sentenced by a court of law for the particular offense to be pardoned.</dd> <dt>Section 2</dt> <dd>The President may not, without the consent of the Congress, grant any pardon for a crime committed while the offender, a co-conspirator of the offender, or an accessory of the offender was an employee or officer of the executive branch.</dd> <dt>Section 3</dt> <dd>The Congress shall have the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.</dd> <dt>Section 4</dt> <dd>This article shall take effect immediately upon its ratification.</dd> </dl> <p>Let the Republicans try to explain to their constituents why passing this amendment would <em>not</em> be in the best interests of the country. Please.</p></p>
