<p>The Seven-Year-Old had been spooked by a book he had been reading in his bed, and I was looking for something to distract him from his fears.  I picked up Sally Miller Gerhart&#8217;s <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=KpgcAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=wanderground">Wanderground</a>, flipped through it, and then thought better of offering it to him.</p>

	<p>&#8220;This probably isn&#8217;t a book for seven-year-olds,&#8221; I said, recalling that although the world the book portrays is bucolic, some of the stories within are less so. &#8220;It&#8217;s a book about a bunch of women who live without any men.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The child, who had seen the map in the frontispiece, asked, &#8220;Is &#8216;Dangerland&#8217; where all the men live?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;How did you figure that out?&#8221;</p>

	<p>(I <em>do</em> actually recommend <i>Wanderground</i>&#8230; to grown-ups. For the purpose of this book, puberty is probably a necessary condition of grown-up-hood, but not a sufficient one.)</p>
