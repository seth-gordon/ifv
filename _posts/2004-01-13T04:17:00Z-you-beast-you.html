<p>When Pharoah asked the midwives why they were letting the Jewish boys live, they claimed that &#8220;the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women, because they are lively <i>[chayot]</i>&#8221; (Exodus 1:19). The Talmud (Sotah 11b) explains: &#8220;They are being compared to wild animals <i>[chayyot]</i>,&#8221; which, as Rashi (s.v.) observes, don&#8217;t need midwives. <p>The Talmud goes on to list verses where children of Israel are compared to animals, such as &#8220;Judah is a lion&#8217;s cub&#8221; (Genesis 49:9). I think one could read the same pun on a different level. The midwives are appealing to Pharoah&#8217;s ethnic prejudice: &#8220;You know those Hebrews. Just like <em>animals,</em> they are.&#8221;</p></p>
