Maybe if I publish this I can get it out of my head&#8230; <h1>A Field is a Number, Time, or String</h1> to the tune of &#8220;A Noun is a Person, Place, or Thing&#8221; by Lynn Ahrens <blockquote class="verse"> <ul> <li>Well, every number you can share</li> <li>And every time that you can spare</li> <li>And every string you can compare</li> <li>You know they&#8217;re fields.</li> <li class="stb">A field&#8217;s part of a database row</li> <li>Which records a fact someone should know;</li> <li>I find it quite interesting.</li> <li>A field&#8217;s a number, time, or string.</li> <li class="mtb">Oh, I bought a ticket for the 10 a.m. New York plane.</li> <li>A man tried to sit in the seat where I was staying.</li> <li>The stewardess said, &#8220;Get off this flight;</li> <li>&#8220;Your plane doesn&#8217;t leave &rsquo;till 10 at night.&#8221;</li> <li>I bought a ticket for the 10 a.m. New York plane.</li> <li class="mtb">Well, every number you can share</li> <li>(like the number of miles to New York)</li> <li>And every time that you can spare</li> <li>(like 10 a.m. or 10 p.m.)</li> <li>And any string you can compare</li> <li>(like the name of an airline or an airport)</li> <li>You know they&#8217;re fields.</li> <li>You know they&#8217;re fields, oh&#8230;</li> <li class="mtb">Mei-Li worked as a clerk at the <abbr title="Registry of Motor Vehicles">R.M.V.,</abbr></li> <li>Giving the tests to see whether people could see.</li> <li>She tested a man with a long last name</li> <li>And now their addresses are the same.</li> <li>Mei-Li worked as a clerk at the R.M.V.</li> <li class="mtb">Well, every number you can share</li> <li>(like the &#8220;20&#8221; in &#8220;20/20 vision&#8221;)</li> <li>And every time that you can spare</li> <li>(like now or yesterday or tomorrow)</li> <li>And any string you can compare</li> <li>(like an address or a last name)</li> <li>You know they&#8217;re fields.</li> <li>You know they&#8217;re fields, oh&#8230;</li> <li class="mtb">Mr. Jones logs in to a bank on Hudson Street.</li> <li>He left his password for a second where his daughter could see it.</li> <li>She took all his money out of the bank</li> <li>And put his credit rating in the tank.</li> <li>Mr. Jones logs in to a bank on Hudson Street.</li> <li class="mtb">Well, every number you can share</li> <li>(like the balance in a bank account)</li> <li>And every time that you can spare</li> <li>(like a second or a minute or an hour)</li> <li>And any string you can compare</li> <li>(like the password or the name of a bank)</li> <li>You know they&#8217;re fields.</li> <li class="stb">A field&#8217;s part of a database row</li> <li>Which records a fact someone should know;</li> <li>I find it quite interesting.</li> <li>A field&#8217;s a number, time, or string.</li> <li class="mtb">A field is a number, time, or string.</li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>Lyrics &copy; Seth Gordon 2004. <!-- Creative Commons License --> <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/1.0/"><img align="right" alt="Creative Commons License" border="0" src="http://creativecommons.org/images/public/somerights.gif"></a><br> This work is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/1.0/">Creative Commons License</a>.
