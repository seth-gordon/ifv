<p>Various news outlets have reported that a pro-life group is <a href="http://www.fox8.com/news/sns-ap-oh--ohioabortions-firstheartbeat,0,1310106.story">calling a fetus as a witness</a> before the Ohio state legislature, which is debating a bill that would outlaw abortion in any case where the embryo or fetus has a detectable heartbeat.</p>

	<p>This is incorrect reportage.</p>

	<p>First, witnesses, by definition, <em>give testimony</em>, and a fetus cannot testify to anything. A fetus can be evidence, but not a witness.</p>

	<p>Second, one does not bring a fetus to the witness stand; one brings <em>a pregnant woman</em>.</p>

	<p>I can understand why the Faith2Action is framing their legislative stunt in this particular way, but the rest of us donâ€™t have to play along. In particular, it would have been nice if the Associated Press had reported <em>the name</em> of the woman who is coming before the committee.</p>
