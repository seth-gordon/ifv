<p>Amy Chua&#8217;s paean to academic stage-motherhood, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704111504576059713528698754.html">“Why Chinese Mothers are Superior”</a>, has been making the rounds on teh intarwebs. I can&#8217;t add much to the commentary surrounding the op-ed itself (there&#8217;s a lot of interesting discussion <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/99339/Why-Chinese-Mothers-Are-Superior">on MetaFilter</a>), but I do want to follow up on a follow-up, as it were.</p>

	<p>On <a href="http://www.quora.com/Parenting/Is-Amy-Chua-right-when-she-explains-Why-Chinese-Mothers-Are-Superior-in-an-op-ed-in-the-Wall-Street-Journal">Quora</a>, a Chinese-American woman reprinted an email she got from Chua:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Thank you for taking the time to write me, and I&#8217;m so sorry about your sister [who was driven to overachieve and committed suicide at age 30].  I did not choose the title of the <span class="caps">WSJ</span> excerpt, and I don&#8217;t believe that there is only one good way of raising children.  The actual book is more nuanced, and much of it is about my decision to retreat from the &#8220;strict Chinese immigrant&#8221; model.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>But millions of <i>Wall Street Journal</i> readers, plus the vast majority of the people passing this link around the Net, are not going to read about any nuance. They are going to feel satisfied by an op-ed that</p>

	<ol>
		<li>satisfies their base interest in dramatic conflict</li>
		<li>confirms a pernicious stereotype about Asians</li>
		<li>teaches that your success in life is 100% controlled by your level of effort</li>
	</ol>

	<p>In the dialect of my own immigrant ancestors: Feh.</p>
