<p>Anatole France was famous for remarking that &#8220;the law in its infinite majesty forbids the rich as well as the poor to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal bread&#8221;. Twenty-first-century capitalism does M.&nbsp;France one better: we break up the homeless encampments with truncheon-wielding police while letting the rich host overnight parties under the adjacent bridge.</p>

	<p>Case in point: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/31/business/economy/31contracts.html?_r=1&amp;em">this <em>New York Times</em> article</a> leads with the sentence &#8220;Contracts everywhere are under assault.&#8221; If you read further, though, it turns out that only <em>employment</em> contracts are everywhere under assault. For example, if you are a unionized police officer or firefighter, and the city where you work declares bankruptcy, then your union&#8217;s contract with the city can be torn up. But if you <em>loaned money</em> to the city by purchasing its bonds, you can be comforted that the bankruptcy code &#8220;was never meant to be a place where governments could get out of their bonded debt&#8221;. Infringe on the rent-collecting power of <em>the bourgeoisie</em>?  Perish the thought!</p>
