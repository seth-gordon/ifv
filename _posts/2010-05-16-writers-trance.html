<p>After a long long hiatus, I am using some of my Copious Free Time for writing science fiction. Not wanting to repeat the mistakes that I saw in a certain Internet imbroglio last year, I am also trying to give myself a better multicultural education, and one of the first books that came to hand was called, natch, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=DN9ZAAAAMAAJ&q=greywolf+annual+multi-cultural+literacy&dq=greywolf+annual+multi-cultural+literacy&hl=en&ei=U4rwS8G4CYL48Ab83eT9Cg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CEYQ6AEwBg"><i>Multi-Cultural Literacy</i></a>. In one essay from that book—&#8220;Tlilli, Tlapalli: The Path of the Red and Black Ink&#8221;, by Gloria Anzaldúa—there is this passage:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>When I create stories in my head, that is, allow the voices and scenes to be projected in the inner screen of my mind, I &#8220;trance.&#8221; I used to think I was going crazy or that I was having hallucinations. But now I realize it is my job, my calling, to traffic in images. Some of these film-like narratives I write down; most are lost, forgotten. When I don&#8217;t write the images down for several days or weeks or months, I get physically ill&#8230;.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>I believe this is the sensation that, in the fanfic community, is known as &#8220;plotbunnies&#8221;.</p>
