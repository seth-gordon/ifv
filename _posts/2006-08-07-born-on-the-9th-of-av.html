A light dinner and <em>mincha/ma`ariv</em> service will follow.</p>

	<p>There is a Jewish tradition that the Messiah will be born on the 9th of Av, the fast day mourning the destruction of the Temple and the exile of the Jewish nation. Unfortunately, since I&#8217;m almost certainly not a descendant of King David, my son, despite his birthday, is almost certainly ineligible to be the Messiah.</p>
