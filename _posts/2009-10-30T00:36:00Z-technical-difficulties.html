<p>Our server has been locking up repeatedly over the past few days, apparently because <a href="http://www.shapeshifter.se/2009/03/03/dspam-converting-from-the-hash-driver-to-mysql-driver/">our spam filter was consuming an obscene amount of memory</a>. I have (probably) fixed the problem, and if it weren&#8217;t less than an hour before sunset on Friday, I would have an extensive and geeky rant about what happened, but instead I will just provide a user-friendly public-service announcement:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>If you have sent email to us in the past few days and you <em>have not</em> received a bounce message from your Internet service provider, we will (probably) get it Real Soon Now. If you <em>did</em> receive a bounce message, it is now (probably) safe to resend the message. If you have been treating email as a communications medium that is generally guaranteed to reach its destination in a matter of hours, please adjust your expectations&#8230; it <em>usually</em> works that way, but nothing in the perverse architecture of the Internet really guarantees that it will do so.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>We apologize for the inconvenience. Unless, of course, you are a spammer.</p>
