<p>It&#8217;s a good sign when your son asks you a question at the Seder that you need to go all the way to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mishnah_Berurah">Mishnah Berurah</a> to answer.</p>

	<p>The question: why do we break the <em>middle</em> matzah?</p>

	<p>The answer (MB 473:57): &#8220;&#8230;because the blessing on the [mitzvah of the] eating of matzah principally applies to it, and the blessing of <em>hamotzi</em> [the generic blessing on eating bread] that is made first applies to the top one that rests on it.&#8221;</p>
