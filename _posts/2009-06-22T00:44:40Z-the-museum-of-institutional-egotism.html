<p>During my brief stay at yeshiva in Israel, we toured some of the archeological sites near Tiberias, and our guide pointed out a number of details about the Roman civil engineering from two thousand years ago.  <i>A tour guide who appreciates technology,</i> I thought.  <i>Cool!</i></p>

	<p>A few months ago, I read about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eupalinian_aqueduct">the tunnel of Eupalinos</a>, an aqueduct dug through a mountain on the Greek island of Samos by two teams starting at opposite sides. The tunnel is an impressive work of engineering when you consider that during the sixth century <span class="caps">BCE</span>, when it was dug, its surveyors had no magnetic compasses, nothing resembling modern surveying instruments, and possibly not even much geometry&#8212;Euclid&#8217;s <i>Elements</i> was written two centuries later. And yet, the two excavation teams intercepted each other in the middle of the mountain, just as Eupalinos had planned. <i>Wow,</i> I thought. <i>If I could ever do a Geek&#8217;s Tour of Europe, that tunnel would be one of my stops.</i></p>

	<p>So, when I heard someone had published <a href="http://www.geekatlas.com/">The Geek Atlas</a>, the first thing I did was look at <a href="http://www.geekatlas.com/page/3338541:Page:164">the map</a> to see if the tunnel of Eupalinos was on the list. To my surprise, it was not; in fact, not a single marker lay in Greece. The only place mentioned in Italy is the <a href="http://www.whatsonwhen.com/sisp/index.htm?fx=event&amp;event_id=169093">Tempio Voltiano</a>, a museum dedicated to Alessandro Volta; nothing about classical Roman engineering <em>here</em>. The Neolithic excavations at <a href="http://www.catalhoyuk.com/">Çatalhöyük</a> are also off the list, but surely I am not the only nerd who trembles at the image of <em>a nine-thousand-year-old city</em>.</p>

	<p>Perplexed, I shuffled the map to see what <em>was</em> in this atlas, and came across a marker near Boston. What local landmark did the author consider worth including among his 128 selections? <a href="http://web.mit.edu/museum/">The <span class="caps">MIT</span> Museum.</a></p>

	<p><i>Oh, for the love of God and Jerome Weisner,</i> I thought, <i>you have got to be kidding.</i></p>

	<p>My wife and I <em>went</em> to the <span class="caps">MIT</span> Museum in January, using our alumni status to get free admission, and we cannot in good conscience advise anyone to pay their own money to get in there. There are a few exhibits related to current research at the Institute, some kinetic sculptures that somebody presumably considers &#8220;art&#8221;, and a <em>lot</em> about our alma mater&#8217;s storied history. If you&#8217;re an <span class="caps">MIT</span> dean who wants to schlep naches from your department&#8217;s work being on exhibit to the public, or a rich and elderly alum looking to stoke your nostalgia for &#8220;Tech&#8221;, maybe you&#8217;ll like that kind of thing. Everyone else can give it a pass.</p>

	<p>If you&#8217;re a geek visiting Boston and looking for something touristy, I can recommend the <a href="http://www.mos.org/">Museum of Science</a>, especially if you have kids. There&#8217;s also the <a href="http://www.hmnh.harvard.edu/">Harvard Museum of Natural History</a>. Or, heck, you can just walk into <span class="caps">MIT</span> itself, wander the halls, and look for posters describing current research. And if you&#8217;re looking for something elsewhere in the world&#8230; I have no idea.</p>

	<p>If anyone out there has come across a <em>real</em> geek atlas, please let me know. In the meantime, I&#8217;m saving my pennies for a trip to Samos and Çatalhöyük.</p>
