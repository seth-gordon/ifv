<p>Excerpt from <em>Tefillah Zakkah</em>:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Knowing as I do that hardly anyone is a righteous person who has not sinned against another one, either financially or physically, in word or in deed&#8212;this makes my heart tremble within me, because Yom Kippur does not atone for interpersonal sins until the offender appeases the victim. Regarding this, my heart is broken within me and my bones shake, because not even death atones. Therefore, I offer prayer before You that You pity me, and give me favor, kindness, and mercy in Your eyes, and in the eyes of all humanity. So I hereby completely forgive anyone who has sinned against me, either physically or financially, or one who gossipped about me, or even lied about me. So too, anyone who harmed me physically or financially. And for every sin that one person can commit against another, except for money that I could collect in a court of law, and except for someone who sins against me and says &#8220;I will hurt him and he will forgive me&#8221;&#8212;except for these, I completely forgive; and let no one be punished on my account. And just as I forgive everyone, so too may You put my favor before everyone else, so that they will completely forgive me.</p>
