<p>So if you have some script<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/#fn19822838454a3aeaf25e4c3">1</a></sup> that was created with the time-honored &#8220;copy, paste, edit&#8221; method of abstraction, and it&#8217;s not doing what you expect, and you&#8217;re just tearing your hair out because the part that you edited is <em>perfectly</em> clear and <em>works just fine</em> when you try it from the command line all by itself, and you&#8217;re not really sure what one of the parts that you copied and pasted is doing but since all these other scripts use the same code surely there&#8217;s nothing wrong with it&#8230; you may want to consider the possibility that there&#8217;s some relationship between the code that you don&#8217;t understand and the output that you don&#8217;t expect.</p>

	<p>There&#8217;s some cutting-edge engineering wisdom that I acquired through bitter and embarrassing experience. I&#8217;ll probably reacquire it next week.</p>

	<p class="fn" id="fn10704540564a3aeaf25f462"><sup>2</sup> If five lines of shell code joined with backslashes can be dignified with the term &#8220;one-liner&#8221;.</p>
