<p>I spent last night in my local hospital for a <a href="http://www.sleepfoundation.org/site/c.huIXKjM0IxF/b.2421159/k.99FE/What_Goes_on_in_a_Sleep_Lab.htm">sleep study</a>. The guy who called to pre-register me sounded like he had been up for 48 consecutive hours.</p>

	<p>They&#8217;ll have the results back to my doctor in two or three weeks.  Take your time, guys!  Don&#8217;t stay up late on my account!</p>
