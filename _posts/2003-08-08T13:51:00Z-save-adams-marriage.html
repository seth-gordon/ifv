<p>Adam Felber has posted a <a href="http://www.felbers.net/mt/archives/001610.html">heartfelt plea</a> to arrest the gay-marriage movement before it&#8230;um&#8230;does something bad to him. <blockquote> <p>&#8230;Because when our gay friends start getting married, it will cheapen and destroy what we have. Not in a religious way (No. Legislating on those grounds would be illegal, for heaven&#8217;s sake!). It&#8217;s more of a general thing. Like, generally, gays getting married will undercut everything Jeanne and I have tried to build because&#8230; because&#8230; it will make our union less special. It will. We&#8217;ll lose interest. We&#8217;ll probably just start thinking, &#8220;What&#8217;s so important about our vows? After all, even <em>gay</em> people can make them.&#8221;&#8230;</p> <p>Straight people are <em>good</em> with marriage, too. Jeanne and I can look around at other married couples &#8212; at least the ones that aren&#8217;t currently dealing with serial infidelity, divorce, spousal abuse, or bigamy &#8212; and think to ourselves, &#8220;Yes, <em>that&#8217;s</em> what we&#8217;re striving for. That kind of sanctity.&#8221; I&#8217;m not sure that gays would show the same universal respect for the institution that comes so easily to us straight people.</p> </blockquote> <p class="via">via <a href="http://www.matthewyglesias.com/archives/001143.html#001143">Matthew Yglesias</a></p></p>
