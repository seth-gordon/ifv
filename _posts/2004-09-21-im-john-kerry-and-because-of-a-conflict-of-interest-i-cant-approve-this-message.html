<p>The September 20 issue of the <cite>New Yorker</cite> has an interesting article by Ken Auletta (not available online) about Bob Shrum, one of John Kerry&#8217;s top advisers. One paragraph in the article particularly caught my attention: <blockquote>&#8230;[M]edia advisers in the Kerry camp had a financial incentive to recommend more advertising. They will divide among themselves about eight million dollars of the advertising budget&#8212;with Shrum Devine Donilon getting about five million dollars. By contrast, the Bush campaign&#8217;s [chief media adviser Mark] McKinnon says he is paid a flat salary (which he refuses to disclose), and he asked for advice from a dozen advertising executives around the country who meet weekly to propose and scrutinize ads. The Kerry campaign did not assemble an outside team, and turned down a chance to use <a href="https://www.moveonpac.org/donate/switchad_winners.html">an advertising campaign created by the filmmaker Errol Morris</a>.</blockquote> <p>If my memory is correct, the Dean campaign had a similar deal with Trippi, McMahon &&nbsp;Squier (now <a href="http://www.msastrategies.com/">McMahon, Squier &&nbsp;Associates</a>), the firm in which Dean&#8217;s campaign manager was a partner; TMS got a commission on each ad that the campaign bought. I don&#8217;t think I spent enough time following the Dean blog and forums to really call myself a Deaniac, but from what little I did see, Dean&#8217;s grass-roots supporters were <a href="http://brushstroke.tv/week04_5.html">none too impressed</a> by the advertisements that TMS produced.</p> <p><b>Update:</b> To be fair to Kerry, <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6039833/site/newsweek/">Shrum has been effectively demoted</a>; the rising stars in the Kerry campaign are going to help him attack Bush more forcefully, focusing on the mess in Iraq.</p></p>
