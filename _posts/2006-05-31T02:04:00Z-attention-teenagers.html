<blockquote><p>Doctors said sexually transmitted diseases among senior citizens are running rampant at a popular Central Florida retirement community, according to a Local 6 News report.</p>
<p>A gynecologist at The Villages community near Orlando, Fla., said she treats more cases of herpes and the human papilloma virus in the retirement community than she did in the city of Miami....</p>
<p>A doctor blamed Viagra, <b>a lack of sex education</b> and no risk for pregnancy for the spike in sexually transmitted diseases at The Villages.</p></blockquote>
