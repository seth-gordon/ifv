<p>Every once in a while, a writer from outside the SF community gets touched by our peculiar muse, and produces an excellent work that is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/038549081X/sr=8-1/qid=1152580899/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-4271709-1492830?ie=UTF8">recognizably SF</a>, or at least <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/015602943X/sr=8-2/qid=1152581089/ref=pd_bbs_2/002-4271709-1492830?ie=UTF8">something damn close to it</a>. Books like this make the true believers grind their teeth and mutter &#8220;if only SF wasn&#8217;t considered a subliterary genre, then books like this would be published as SF, and people who liked them would actually deign to consider reading other SF books.&#8221;</p>
	<p>Then, every once in a while, we encounter books like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312340966/qid=1152581244/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/002-4271709-1492830?s=books&#38;v=glance&#38;n=283155"><em>Prodigy</em></a>, which do not bear the imprint of any SF publishing house, and thank God and Campbell for that.  This tale, by a man who was &#8220;kicked out of several prep schools&#8221;, is about the prep school of the future: Stansbury, which charges $500K tuition (in 2036 dollars) to cultivate young minds using nonunion labor, cutting-edge drugs, and a rigorous educational program, thus turning out hordes of young men and women ready to <del>fight aliens</del> become leaders of science, industry, and athletics. The murder-mystery-cum-thriller plot is nothing special; this book is distinguished by such thrilling flights of speculation as:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>The rubber-Teflon blend in the soles of Smith&#8217;s work boots&#8230;gripped the slick pavement as he pivoted into an alley off 3rd Street on Avenue R.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Wow, it&#8217;s a good thing the sneaker companies of the future thought to mix rubber with the Teflon in their soles, so that the shoes could grip the pavement better.</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>The dopazone molecules transferred digitally from the site&#8217;s mainframe server to Cooley&#8217;s terminal by bouncing in between thirty-eight separate destinations, all of which were decoys designed to throw off Stansbury&#8217;s built-in security system&#8230;. The dopazone molecules rode the electric currents and shot through the wrist cuff, transferring past the skin and into his bloodstream.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>I&#8217;ve heard of Internet addiction, but <em>really</em>...!</p>
	<p>Nothing to see here for anyone with a passing knowledge of science fiction, except perhaps as an object lesson in How Not To. If you run into any <em>non</em>-fen who have read this book and actually liked it, please beg them to pick up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553380958/sr=8-1/qid=1152583167/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-4271709-1492830?ie=UTF8">some SF thriller by a writer who&#8217;s actually competent</a>.</p>
