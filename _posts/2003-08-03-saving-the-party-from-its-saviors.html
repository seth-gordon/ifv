<p>The Democratic Leadership Council, which fancies itself a bastion of moderation against the special-interest hordes, Just Doesn&#8217;t Get It, and Digby <a href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2003_07_27_digbysblog_archive.html#105953466772225957">has their number</a>: <blockquote> <blockquote>&#8220;The Internet may be giving angry, protest-oriented activists the rope they need to hang the party,&#8221; wrote Randolph Court in the DLC&#8217;s bimonthly newsletter, The New Democrat Blueprint.</blockquote> <p>I sure wish that the Republicans had believed that about talk radio because then we&#8217;d hold both houses of congress, the presidency and the courts today&#8230;.</p> <p>This is a terrible misconception and one that will indeed &#8220;hang the party&#8221; because these guys are not only out of touch with their own party, they are obviously delusional about the opposition. They don&#8217;t recognize that the political landscape has completely changed since 1985 when the DLC was created and 1992 when it reached its zenith of power. In 2004 it is losing its relevance to many Democrats, not because of a difference in policy but because it has failed to recognize that while they have not changed, the Republican Party has undergone a complete metamorphosis. They do not seem to understand that when the competition completely changes strategy, you must be prepared to change strategy as well.</p> <p>The Republican Party of George W. Bush is fundamentally different than the Party of George H.W. Bush. They are playing a form of political hardball that is completely unresponsive to the cooperative, consensus style politics that characterizes the DLC. They will not budge on policy and when it comes to tactics they are knife wielding thugs.</p> <p>Dean&#8217;s early success isn&#8217;t about liberal spending programs and &#8220;far left&#8221; hatred for Junior. It&#8217;s about opening your eyes and seeing what is right in front of your face &#8212; a dangerously radical Republican party that simply will not compromise or deal fairly.</p> </blockquote></p>
