<p>In a posting last year, I remarked that <a href="http://dynamic.ropine.com/yo/politics/feminism/gid/what.html">women and men have remarkably different relationships with their same-sex platonic friends, but biographies of transsexuals don&#8217;t reveal much about their platonic friendships</a>. I was intrigued, therefore, to come across a certain passage in <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0060929596">As Nature Made Him</a>, John Colapinto&#8217;s book about Bruce a.k.a. Brenda a.k.a. David Reimer. <p>For those unfamiliar with the case: when Bruce Reimer was eight months old, most of his penis was burned off in a botched circumcision. Following the advice of the famed psychologist John Money, they renamed the child Brenda and tried to raise her as a girl. Brenda had emotional problems throughout her childhood, rebelling against everything associated with girlhood, and when she found out about her medical history as a teenager, she insisted on being reassigned as male.</p> <p>During her childhood as Brenda, one of Reimer&#8217;s few friends was a classmate named Heather Legarry. Colapinto reports:</p> <blockquote>Heather&#8230;valued Brenda as a girl devoid of the <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/theferrett/466248.html">duplicity and backstabbing</a> that had poisoned so many of her relations with girls in the past and that even threatened the harmony of her current clique of tomboys. &#8220;Brenda didn&#8217;t speak much,&#8221; Heather says, &#8220;but when she did she was never vindictive or false. She was very honest. If she told me something was black or white, it was.&#8221; (p.&nbsp;125; link added)</blockquote> <p>As transsexuals go, Reimer is hardly typical, but I&#8217;ll take my data points wherever I can get them.</p> <p class="via">see also <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/lyonesse/227608.html">these comments from lyonesse</a>, who worked in Prof.&nbsp;Money&#8217;s lab, on Reimer</p></p>
