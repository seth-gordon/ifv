<p>There are many Deep and Meaningful and Significant things I would like to ramble about at great length, which of course is one reason why I haven&#8217;t posted anything here for six weeks.  So here&#8217;s a shallow and insignificant thought for the day.</p>
	<p>Our microwave oven has a <del>button</del> touch-sensitive blob labelled &#8220;ADD MINUTE&#8221;.  If you push it, it doesn&#8217;t actually add a minute to the cooking time; it adds thirty seconds.  But if the timer is already above a certain threshold, or maybe when you push the button enough times in rapid succession, each press <em>does</em> add one minute to the cooking time.</p>
	<p>But now I have a vision of the world&#8217;s most concise microwave-oven interface (imagine putting this on one of those itty bitty cubes): two <del>buttons</del> touch-sensitive blobs, “&#x2b;&#8221; and “✕&#8221;.  If you press “+&#8221; the time on the clock goes up by ten seconds, and if you press “✕&#8221; the time on the clock triples.  So thirty seconds is “+✕&#8221;.  One minute is “++✕&#8221;.  Five minutes would be “+✕✕+✕&#8221;. (From what I&#8217;ve read about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_numeral_system">ternary arithmetic</a>, I suspect that making “✕&#8221; use any factor other than three would make the average button-pushing sequence longer, but I&#8217;m too lazy to work out a proof.)</p>
	<p>I release this innovative user interface into the public domain for the benefit of microwave-oven users everywhere. Please, don&#8217;t be too effusive in your thanks.</p>
	<p>P.S.: As long as I&#8217;m on the topic of weird number systems, I direct your attention to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio_base">golden-ratio base</a>, a system for representing numbers in base φ (or, if you&#8217;re a <em>Da Vinci Code</em> fan, base PHI).  Since φ+1 = φ<sup>2</sup>, any integer can be represented by a finite sequence of base-φ digits, <em>even though</em> φ is irrational. There must be some practical use for this, but I haven&#8217;t thought of one yet.</p>
