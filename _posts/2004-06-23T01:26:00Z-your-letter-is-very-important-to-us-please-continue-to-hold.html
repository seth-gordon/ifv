<p>This morning, I discovered that the /home partition on my mail server (a venerable 486 in our basement) was full, much to the consternation of <a href="http://cr.yp.to/qmail.html">qmail</a> and <a href="http://www.inter7.com/index.php?page=courierimap">courier-imap</a>. I cleaned up my home directory on that server and everything seemed to be working again. My wife reported that she didn&#8217;t notice any problems with her own mail due to the problem, but she has had less spam than usual. <p><tt><sarcasm></tt> This gives me a wonderful idea for a spam-filtering technique: for 12 hours out of every 24, simply block all incoming email connections on your server. For legitimate users who send mail to a blocked machine, their ISPs&#8217; mail servers will simply try again in a few hours, but the bulk-mail senders that spammers use probably won&#8217;t bother, because those programs are designed for people who want to fire off a few million messages and move on before they can be traced. Sure, any email that you care about receiving could be delayed for some random length of time, but that&#8217;s the price you pay for <em>reducing incoming spam by half</em>. Or you could block those connections for 18 hours out of every 24, and reduce incoming spam by two-thirds&#8230; <tt></sarcasm></tt></p> <p><tt><serious-digression></tt> As <a href="http://cr.yp.to/im2000.html">D. J. Bernstein observes</a>, one of the fundamental flaws in Internet email is that the recipient (or the recipient&#8217;s ISP) is responsible for storing his or her own mail. It would make much more sense for the sender (or the sender&#8217;s ISP) to take responsibility for storing messages and simply tell the recipient, &#8220;the next time you read your mail, there&#8217;s a message waiting for you to download at such-and-such a place&#8221;. If the Internet worked that way, then spam would be much less of a problem, because any message could be traced back to a server under the sender&#8217;s control with a permanent Internet connection, and the person owning that connection could be held accountable. And the odds of <em>ever</em> getting the whole Internet to make such a radical shift in the way it uses email are &#8230; well, about equal to the odds of getting all the spammers to give up their trade out of the goodness of their hearts. <tt></serious-digression></tt></p></p>
