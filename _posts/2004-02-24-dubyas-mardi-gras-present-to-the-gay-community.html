<p>Excerpt from <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A2078-2004Feb24?language=printer">Bush&#8217;s speech</a> today: <blockquote> <p>Today, I call upon the Congress to promptly pass and to send to the states for ratification an amendment to our Constitution defining and protecting marriage as a union of a man and woman as husband and wife.</p> <p>The amendment should fully protect marriage, while leaving the state legislatures free to make their own choices in defining legal arrangements other than marriage.</p> </blockquote> Contrast this with the <a href="http://www.johnkerry.com/issues/glbt/">Kerry campaign Web site</a>: <blockquote>John Kerry supports same-sex civil unions so that gay couples can benefit from the health benefits, inheritance rights, or Social Security survivor benefits guaranteed for heterosexual couples.</blockquote> <p>Got it? Bush wants to preserve <em>marriage</em> as a heterosexual-only institution, while leaving state legislatures free to authorize civil unions. Kerry, on the other hand, wants to preserve marriage as a heterosexual-only institution, while leaving state legislatures free to authorize <em>civil unions</em>.</p> <p>OK, there is one significant difference: Kerry would want members of civil unions to be eligible for Federal benefits, such as Social Security, on the same terms as married couples. However, since the Republicans are likely to control Congress no matter who wins the Presidential election, any bill proposing to change those eligibility rules would go down in flames.</p> <p>Note to evangelical Christians: Now that both parties have demonstrated their profound disinterest in writing your <em>sexual</em> morals into the law, perhaps you could review the <em>other</em> sins that Jesus called attention to, and decide which party&#8217;s platform is more consistent with Christian morality <em>as a whole</em>. If &#8220;it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of Heaven&#8221; (Mark 10:25), what effect will the Bush tax cuts have on celestial population growth?</p> <p class="via">via <a href="http://balkin.blogspot.com/2004_02_22_balkin_archive.html#107764241564716685">Balkinization</a></p></p>
