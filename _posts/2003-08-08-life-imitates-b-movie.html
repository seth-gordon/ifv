<p>In <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0106697">Demolition Man</a>, Sylvester Stallone plays a cop who is cryogenically preserved for thirty years and then thawed out in a sterilized future. As she brings him up to date with current events, Sandra Bullock makes a passing reference to &#8220;President Schwarzenegger.&#8221; Stallone is confused, since Ah-nold isn&#8217;t a natural-born citizen. Oh, Bullock says, he was so popular that we amended the Constitution to allow him to run. <p>Ten years later, the Terminator is running for governor of California, and Sen.&nbsp;Orrin Hatch (R&#8211;Utah) has introduced <a href="http://www.discontent.com/blog/aphrael/archives/000220.html#000220">a Constitutional amendment</a> that would allow people who have been US citizens for twenty years to become President.</p> <p>I suppose I could live with a Schwarzenegger Administration: he&#8217;s more liberal than Reagan, after all, and more articulate than Dubya.</p> <p class="via">via <a href="http://www.matthewyglesias.com/archives/001140.html#001140">Matthew Yglesias</a></p></p>
