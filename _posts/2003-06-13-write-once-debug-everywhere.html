<p>If you&#8217;re installing Java on a system running some variety of Linux other than Red Hat, make sure you have installed whatever package includes the <code>libstdc++-libc6.1-1.so.2</code> shared object file; this is a library that allows C++ code that was compiled with an earlier version of the GNU C++ compiler run on a contemporary system. Sun&#8217;s installation instructions tell you to install the <tt>compat-libstdc++-6.21-2.9.0.0.i386.rpm</tt> package if you&#8217;re using Red Hat Advanced Server, but say nothing about the other distributions. <p>I used to have a much longer posting here describing all the trauma I suffered along the way to learning this fun fact, but typing in the whole story practically bored me to sleep, so there&#8217;s no need to subject you to the same misery.</p></p>
