<p>Tim Bray <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/07/11/New-Public-Relations" target="_blank" class="blines3" title="Link outside of this blog">looks forward</a> to an era where blogging will create a &#8220;new public relations&#8221;, where senior managers teach employees their companies&#8217; &#8220;goals and messages&#8221;, and regular employees, not just PR specialists, spread them to everyone else who cares to read about them.</p> <p>Bray assures managers that this new system would not make them look bad, unless their organization is so dysfunctional that griping in blogs is the least of their problems. What I wonder is: will this make <em>employees</em> look bad? Will an employee with a widely-read blog get a better performance evaluation, on the grounds that the blog creates positive buzz for the company? Will <a href="http://nytimes.com/2005/07/17/fashion/sundaystyles/17LOVE.html?pagewanted=print" target="_blank" class="blines3" title="Link outside of this blog">insecure parents</a> not only read <a href="http://subvic.blogspot.com/2005/07/sorry-to-disappoint-you.html" target="_blank" class="blines3" title="Link outside of this blog">their nannies&#8217; blogs</a>, but demand that charming anecdotes about their children be posted there?</p> <p>How long until some poor soul discovers that he or she has been fired for <em>not blogging enough?</em></p>
