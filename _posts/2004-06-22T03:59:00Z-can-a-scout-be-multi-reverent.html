<p>On Sunday, we attended a Court of Honor for a friend of ours who was being invested as an Eagle Scout. The honoree belongs to one of the Scout troops for observant Jews. <p>After the ceremonies, <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/lucretia_borgia/">my wife</a> and <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/queendeb/">the fledgling eagle&#8217;s sister</a> worked up the courage to ask one of the Scoutmasters: could you be a pagan Scout? (One would think that Druids would have a particular interest&#8230;) The Scoutmaster told us that there weren&#8217;t enough pagan troops to create a religious emblem for pagans, like the <a href="http://www.scouting.org/awards/religious/awards/16.html">Ner Tamid</a> for Jews, but there were a number of <a href="http://www.scouting.org/awards/religious/awards/28.html">Zoroastrians</a>. We can infer by the <a href="http://www.jargon.8hz.com/html/Z/Zero-One-Infinity-Rule.html">Zero-One-Infinity Rule</a> that if a religion that believes in <em>two</em> deities is kosher with the Boy Scouts of America, then a religion with a pantheon of any nonzero size is kosher.</p> <p>Indeed, a little Googling turned up <a href="http://eagle.webpipe.net/scouts.htm">a Boy Scout troop in Utah</a> (apparently defunct) that was sponsored by <a href="http://eagle.eagleut.com/">a community that worships the traditional Northern European gods</a>. (If the members of this troop spend too long hiking, do they get Thor feet?)</p></p>
