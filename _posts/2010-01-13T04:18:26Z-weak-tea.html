<p>Hall&#8217;s Third Rule of Politics states: &#8220;Constituency always outweighs consistency.&#8221; Thus, activists who fly the banner of the &#8220;Tea Party&#8221; have been eager to condemn &#8220;socialist&#8221; government spending. But the tea-partiers in Michigan have found one government spending program they like: <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/news/2010/01/few_show_up_for_protest_at_detroit_auto_show.php">the auto-industry bailout</a>.</p>

	<p>Joan Fabiano, a tea-partier and former GM employee, justified her non-protest by saying: &#8220;Would you like to see yourself out of a job if your company&#8217;s leadership made the errors and you had <span class="caps">NOTHING</span> to do with it?&#8221;</p>

	<p>Ma&#8217;am, we have this word for economies where company leaders, no matter how incompetent, end up choosing which employees keep their jobs. The word is &#8220;capitalism&#8221;.</p>
