<p>If you&#8217;re reading this blog over LiveJournal or another RSS syndicator, I&#8217;d like to point out a new feature on <a href="http://dynamic.ropine.com/yo/">the main page</a>. In the upper right, under the <cite>ta shema</cite> headline, there&#8217;s a list of links to pages that I found amusing, insightful, or otherwise worth reading, but aren&#8217;t worth the pixels for a full blog post. If you read the page in a newish browser, holding the mouse pointer over a link will also pop up a box with a brief quote or comment.</p>
