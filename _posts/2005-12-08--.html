<p>And <a href="http://aolsvc.news.aol.com/news/article.adp?id=20051205114709990014">Reuters</a> spake unto the Internet, saying: <blockquote> <p>A German Protestant youth group has put together a 2006 calendar with 12 staged photos depicting erotic scenes from the Bible, including a bare-breasted Delilah cutting Samson&#8217;s hair and a nude Eve offering an apple&#8230;.</p> <p>Anne Rohmer, 21, poses on a doorstep in garters and stockings as the prostitute Rahab, who is mentioned in both New and Old Testaments. &#8220;We wanted to represent the Bible in a different way and to interest young people,&#8221; she told Reuters.</p> <p>&#8220;Anyway, it doesn&#8217;t say anywhere in the Bible that you are forbidden to show yourself nude.&#8221;</p> </blockquote> <p>(Well, there is Paul&#8217;s remark in 1 Corinthians 11:5&#8211;15 about women covering their hair. But even among Christian fundamentalists who keep their bodies covered below the neckline, not very many people take this instruction literally.)</p> <p>This looks like the perfect Christmas present for your favorite televangelist. Maybe send it bundled with a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345418824/qid=1133964975/sr=8-2/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i2_xgl14/002-6386595-0760811?n=507846&amp;s=books&amp;v=glance"><i>The Harlot by the Side of the Road</i></a>.</p> <p class="via">via <a href="http://highclearing.com/index.php/archives/2005/12/06/4741">Unqualified Offerings</a></p></p>
