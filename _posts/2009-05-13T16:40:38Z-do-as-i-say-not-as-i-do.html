	<blockquote>
		<p>A former youth adviser at a Bridgeport church was arrested Monday after police said he sexually assaulted a 16-year-old Trumbull girl he was counseling about sexual abstinence&#8230;</p>
		<p>In an interview with police detectives, [the defendant] allegedly said he had been counseling teenage girls, including the victim, on how to say &#8220;no&#8221; to sexual advances from adults.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Perhaps this fellow, not to mention his church, should spend less time teaching girls how to say &#8220;no&#8221;, and more time teaching boys that &#8220;no means no&#8221;.</p>
