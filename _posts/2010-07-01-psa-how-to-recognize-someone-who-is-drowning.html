<blockquote>
		<p>The Instinctive Drowning Response&#8230; does not look like most people expect.  There is very little splashing, no waving, and no yelling or calls for help of any kind.  To get an idea of just how quiet and undramatic from the surface drowning can be, consider this:  It is the number two cause of accidental death in children, age 15 and under (just behind vehicle accidents) â€“ of the approximately 750 children who will drown next year, about 375 of them will do so within 25 yards of a parent or other adult.  <strong>In ten percent of those drownings, the adult will actually watch them do it, having no idea it is happening.</strong></p>
