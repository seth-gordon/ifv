<p>An Israeli guard-dog supplier is trying to sell West Bank settlements on <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3221079.stm">guard pigs</a>. One argument in favor of the pigs, according to Kuti Ben-Yaakov, is that &#8220;according to the Muslim faith, a terrorist who touches a pig is not eligible for the 70 virgins in heaven.&#8221; <a href="http://www.muhajabah.com/islamicblog/archives/veiled4allah/007175.php">Al-Muhajabaha</a> links to a <a href="http://63.175.194.25/index.php?ln=eng&ds=qa&lv=browse&QR=22713&dgn=4">fatwa</a> refuting this idea. <p>Likewise, <a href="http://www.snopes.com/rumors/pershing.htm">other nudniks</a> have suggested that shooting Muslim terrorists with lard-covered bullets, or wrapping their corpses in pigskin, will deter their comrades.</p> <p>Five hundred years ago, <a href="http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~rs143/map6.jpg">Muslim empires</a> controlled southeastern Europe, northern Africa, most of India, and a chunk of the South Pacific. If pork could really function as a sort of anti-Muslim kryptonite, don&#8217;t you think some Christians, Hindus, or other infidels would have noticed this gimmick long before then, and stopped the imperial expansion in its tracks?</p> <p>I know that &#8220;all Jews are smart&#8221; is a stereotype, but some people are <em>trying too hard</em> to refute it&#8230;</p></p>
