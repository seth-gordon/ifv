<p>As an <a href="http://bloglines.com/public/sethg">avid blog reader</a>, I admit that the <a href="http://www.conventionbloggers.com/">blog coverage of the Democratic National Convention</a> underwhelmed me. But as a Democrat, I am overjoyed that the party gave bloggers this unprecedented visibility. Whoever suggested inviting bloggers to the DNC deserves a high-ranking position in the Kerry Administration&#8217;s media-relations office. <p>Think of all the blog-related coverage last week in the <em>mainstream</em> media: stories about the DNC&#8217;s decision to give credentials to bloggers, stories about blogs in general, human-interest pieces about individual big-name bloggers, hand-wringing about the bloggers versus professional journalists, etc., etc. Every column-inch of those newspaper stories, and every second of that broadcast time, was a column-inch and a second <em>not</em> spent covering the Republicans&#8217; response to all the Democrats&#8217; campaign speeches.</p></p>
