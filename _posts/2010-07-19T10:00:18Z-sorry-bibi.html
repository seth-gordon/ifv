<p>The Nine Days are an appropriate time for Jews to repent, and it is appropriate for me to repent for being too cynical about the Israeli political process.  I had assumed that the Israeli government is so <em>in</em>dependent of the Diaspora<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/#fn14647494844c442469cc221">1</a></sup> that complaints from liberal American Jews could not possibly block MK Rotem&#8217;s proposed conversion bill. <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100718/ap_on_re_mi_ea/ml_israel_religion">I was wrong.</a> חטאתי.</p>

	<p class="fn" id="fn14647494844c442469cc221"><sup>1</sup> Note that for all the fulminations over the &#8220;Jewish lobby&#8221;, the Israeli government probably gets more political benefit in the US from evangelical Christians than it does from the Jews who live here.</p>
