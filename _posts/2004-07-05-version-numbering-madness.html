<p>Once upon a time in 1998, Sun Microsystems released &#8220;Java 1.0&#8221; onto an unsuspecting world. As is the case with most &#8220;1.0&#8221; products that neither embarass nor bankrupt their sponsors, this was followed by &#8220;Java 1.1&#8221;. When it was time for the next version to be released, there must have been some kind of tug of war between the development and marketing wings of the company: as far as hackers were concerned, it was &#8220;Java 1.2,&#8221; but as far as the marketing department was concerned, it was &#8220;Java 2&#8221;. At some point&#8212;I don&#8217;t know whether this was at the 1.2 or 1.3 release&#8212;the Java platform split into &#8220;Java 2 Standard Edition,&#8221; &#8220;Java 2 Micro Edition,&#8221; and &#8220;Java 2 Enterprise Edition.&#8221; But at any rate, when the version numbers were bumped again, you didn&#8217;t have &#8220;Java 2 Standard Edition&#8221; become &#8220;Java 3 Standard Edition&#8221;; instead, it was &#8220;Java 2 Standard Edition 1.3.&#8221; Likewise for 1.4. <p>And now, Sun is almost ready to foist a new version of Java on us, and what do they call it? <a href="http://www.sun.com/smi/Press/sunflash/2004-06/sunflash.20040628.3.html">&#8220;Java 2 Platform Standard Edition (J2SE) 5.0.&#8221;</a></p> <p>I hear that Sun is in difficult financial straits these days. Free advice: fire your marketing department before they announce &#8220;Son of Java 2 Platform Extended Turbocharged Standard Edition 2010, Release 7.1.&#8221;</p></p>
