<p>We spent December 25&#8211;30 in California, so that my mother and her partner could see the little one on her own turf. The experience taught me a valuable lesson: If you are about to get on a plane and you recently had a cold, <strong>even if you feel fine</strong>, take a course of decongestants. It&#8217;s amazing how little it takes to make one&#8217;s eardrum feel like the lid of a vigorously shaken beer bottle. Ow. Ow. Ow. <p>But aside from that, and our toddler&#8217;s failure to switch time zones, and his frustration at trying to fall asleep in one of these accursed half-size hotel cribs, and his waking up every ten minutes on the overnight flight back, it was a fun trip, really. Which is why I got back to blogging so promptly after our return.</p></p>
