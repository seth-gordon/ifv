<p>...but comments have been temporarily disabled.</p>  <p>After <a href="http://melted-snowball.livejournal.com/213299.html?nc=2">a new reader noticed some particularly amusing comment spam</a>, I searched some more through my archives, and installed a plugin to email me every time a new comment was posted, and&#8230;wow.</p>  <p>Unfortunately, <a href="http://blosxom.com/">blosxom</a> (or, more precisely, blosxom&#8217;s standard &#8220;writeback&#8221; plugin) stores all the comments for one post in a single flat file, and has neither a spam-filter plugin nor a Web-based administrative interface.  Therefore, managing comment spam&#8212;an essential part of managing any blog that&#8217;s open to comments and is indexed by Google&#8212;is a major pain.  In the long run (hopefully within a week or so), I&#8217;m going to migrate this blog to a different platform.  In the short run, I&#8217;ve turned off the writeback plugin.</p>  <p>You can still comment on recent postings in <em>yesh omrim</em>&#8217;s <a href="http://syndicated.livejournal.com/sethg/">LiveJournal feed</a> (if, that is, you <strike>have been assimilated into the Collective</strike>have an LJ account).  Or you can send me email. And you should.  Because we care.</p>
