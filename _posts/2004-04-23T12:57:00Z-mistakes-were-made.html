<p>The <span class="caps">DNC</span> has used clips from Dubya&#8217;s recent press conference to produce a campaign ad (<a href="http://mfile.akamai.com/8082/wmv/www.democrats.org/video/mistakes2.asx">Windows Media Player version</a>, <a href="http://mfile.akamai.com/8082/rm/www.democrats.org/video/mistakes2.ram">Real Player version</a>). <p><a href="http://arkhangel.blogs.com/counterpoint/2004/04/notations.html">Arkhangel</a> calls this &#8220;the first great negative ad of this campaign &#8230; Someone at the <span class="caps">DNC</span> should &#8230; plaster the airwaves from now until November with this ad. It&#8217;s that good.&#8221; <a href="http://www.discourse.net/archives/2004/04/is_this_ad_effective.html">Michael Froomkin</a> isn&#8217;t so sure: &#8220;shouldn&#8217;t someone at least jazz it up a bit with visuals: the flight suit, for example? One of the stills of the flag-draped coffins that just got Tami Cilicio&#8212;and her husband&#8212;fired?&#8221;</p> <p>I tend to agree more with Arkhangel. Froomkin&#8217;s question reminds me of an epigram from a book on marketing that I read many many years ago: &#8220;Interesting words need boring graphics.&#8221;</p></p>
