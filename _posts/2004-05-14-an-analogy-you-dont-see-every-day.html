<p><a href="http://www.tnr.com/blog/campaignjournal?pid=1649">Ryan Lizza on the most unpopular job in the Bush Administration</a>: <blockquote>&#8230;the White House counterterrorism job is the bureaucratic equivalent of the drummer in Spinal Tap. Bush has now gone through five [er, <a href="http://www.tnr.com/blog/campaignjournal?pid=1650">six</a>] of them since 9/11. (Clinton had one.) Like Spinal Tap&#8217;s drummers, who often choked on their own vomit or spontaneously combusted, Bush&#8217;s counterterrorism aides all seem to disappear under unusual circumstances.</blockquote> <p>We have nothing to fear but &#8230; um &#8230; I&#8217;ll get back to you on that.</p> <p class="via">via <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/2004_archives/000823.html">Brad DeLong</a></p></p>
