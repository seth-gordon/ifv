<p>The dame&#8217;s hips were a liberal&#8217;s dream: small on the top, a robust middle class, and a popular base of support. She dropped into the armchair across from my desk. I poured her a shot of Jack Daniels. (After Iowa, the Gephardt boys had gone a little wild, and broke all my bottles of Scotch.) <p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong, sweetheart?&#8221; I asked.</p> <p>The bell curve of her lower lip shook. &#8220;He&#8217;s dead.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Who?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Howard Dean.&#8221;</p> <p>I raised my eyebrows. &#8220;Another plane crash?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;I mean, his campaign.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Dead? Says who?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;The news, the blogs &#8230; everyone. Their new campaign manager says they can keep going, even if they don&#8217;t win any states on Tuesday. But when I tell my friends that, they laugh at me and&#8230;&#8221; She downed the whiskey and choked back tears.</p> <p>&#8220;Let me guess. They say something about Kool-Aid and dot-com bubbles, right?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Is it true? Am I crazy to hope?&#8221; Her lips left a mark on the tumbler, red as the 2003 Federal budget.</p> <p>&#8220;Politics is a crazy business, sweetheart. Most of the <a href="http://www.pollingreport.com/wh04dem.htm">national tracking polls</a>, there&#8217;s a four-way statistical tie for second: Dean, Edwards, Clark, and Undecided. If Dean is a busted dot-com bubble, then Edwards is a factory on its way to China, and Clark is pinned down in his trench by enemy fire from all sides.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s it? Two states have voted, and Senator Kerry&#8217;s big hair is going to lead the Democrats in November?&#8221;</p> <p>I poured myself another glass. &#8220;Hard to say, sweetheart. On the one hand, Clinton skipped Iowa and lost New Hampshire in &#8217;92, and he went on to be nominated. On the other hand, Clinton had a lot more time between New Hampshire and the next primary to connect with the voters and overcome his bad press. Your man&#8217;s only had a week.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Why is it different this year?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;The Party <a href="http://www.thenation.com/doc.mhtml%3Fi=20020121&s=nichols">decided to compress the schedule</a> two years ago. They wanted to shut down the circular firing squad and pick a nominee as soon as possible, voters or not. Kennedy challenging Carter in &#8217;76, Hart beating on Mondale in &#8217;84&#8212;from Terry McAuliffe&#8217;s point of view, those guys were doing the Republicans&#8217; job, making the front-runners defend themselves against someone in their own party instead of beating the drum against the Republicans.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;But you said yourself, it took the voters a while to warm up to Clinton in the primaries, and he won two terms. And if the circular firing squad is such a bad thing, what have all the candidates been doing for the past year and a half?&#8221;</p> <p>I refilled her glass. It was the best answer I could come up with.</p></p>
