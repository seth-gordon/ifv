<p>Like most of my co-workers, I have long expected that my happy little GeoStartup would some day be acquired by a much larger company—the <span class="caps">IPO</span> market being kind of <i>shvakh</i> these days—but I was surprised to learn <em>which</em> company ended up acquiring us. After having some time to reflect, though, I can appreciate what a far-sighted decision that was. A corporate group that purchases its raw materials in 55 different countries, manufactures its products in 10, distributes them from 16, and offers retail outlets in 25; a group with over a hundred thousand employees and over 20 billion euros in annual sales; a brand known worldwide for low prices, quality manufacturing, and social conscience; one that continually strives to improve itself—surely such a corporate colossus can find new and innovative uses for a cutting-edge Geographic Search and Reference Platform.</p>
