<p>I&#8217;m not sure how concerned I should be about <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0335345/">The Passion of the Christ</a>. Jews, of all people, should know that no text is self-interpreting. If millions of people see the movie, and none of them interpret it in a way that does not inspire them to harm Jews, I have nothing to complain about. If some of them consider it an antisemitic movie, but respond by abandoning Christianity, likewise. If some of them <em>are</em> inspired to commit violence against Jews, the actual violence is a matter for the police. <p>Also, I can&#8217;t shake the feeling that Gibson, observing what Christian outrage did for the box-office sales of <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0089366/">Hail Mary</a> and <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0095497/">The Last Temptation of Christ</a>, has stoked Jewish outrage to sell tickets.</p> <p>I am sure of one thing, though. If, God forbid, I were a Christian&nbsp;&#8212; especially a Catholic&nbsp;&#8212; I would be <em>very</em> concerned about this movie. After all, if I were a Christian, this gore-fest with feints at &#8220;historical accuracy&#8221; (Aramaic dialogue, but a white Jesus?!) would be purporting to represent <em>my religion</em>.</p> <p>To their credit, some Christians have looked at the movie and recoiled. <a href="http://www.andrewsullivan.com/index.php?dish_inc=archives/2004_02_22_dish_archive.html#107777885354905430">Andrew Sullivan</a>, for example, called it &#8220;some kind of sick combination of the theology of Opus Dei and the film-making of Quentin Tarantino.&#8221; <a href="http://tnr.com/easterbrook.mhtml?pid=1378">Greg Easterbrook</a> compares and contrasts: &#8220;The Gospels emphasize Christ&#8217;s suffering on the cross; Gibson has decided to emphasize Christ&#8217;s suffering via the whip. Strange that Gibson should feel he understands Jesus&#8217; final hours better than the Gospel writers did.&#8221; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/01/opinion/01SAFI.html?ex=1393477200&en=b9d26c6071938613&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND">William Safire</a> asks: &#8220;At a moment when a wave of anti-Semitic violence is sweeping Europe and the Middle East, is religion well served by updating the Jew-baiting passion plays of Oberammergau on DVD?&#8221;</p> <p>Then we have the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops Office for Film & Broadcasting, whose <a href="http://www.usccb.org/movies/p/thepassionofthechrist.htm">review</a> has the following high points: &#8220;However &#8230; And though &#8230; &#8216;Nostra Aetate&#8217; &#8230; Overall &#8230; However &#8230; However &#8230; Nonetheless &#8230; flaws as well as triumphs &#8230;&#8221; The review concludes by rating the movie &#8220;A-III&#8221;, meaning that <cite>Passion</cite>, like <a href="http://www.usccb.org/movies/l/leftbehindthemovie.htm">Left Behind: The Movie</a>, is appropriate for all adults without reservation, but not for children and adolescents.</p> <p>So what movies does this august body <em>not</em> consider appropriate for any random grown-up to sit back and enjoy? A selection follows. All direct quotes are from reviews on the USCCB&#8217;s Web site.</p> <p>The USCCB rates the following movies as &#8220;A-IV&#8221; or &#8220;L&#8221;, meaning that they have &#8220;problematic content&#8221; or &#8220;require caution and some analysis&#8221;:</p> <dl> <dt><a href="http://www.usccb.org/movies/b/bedazzled.htm">Bedazzled</a></dt> <dd>Dudley Moore plays a short-order cook in a parody/update of the Faust legend in which &#8220;the lust sequence gets a bit too sinful and another satirizing the image of nuns may seem more distasteful than funny.&#8221;</dd> <dt><a href="http://www.usccb.org/movies/b/thebeliever.htm">The Believer</a></dt> <dd>A self-hating Jew rises through the ranks of a neo-Nazi organization in a movie with &#8220;some hateful violence, a suicide, a sexual encounter with nudity and recurring rough language.&#8221;</dd> <dt><a href="http://www.usccb.org/movies/b/thebody.htm">The Body</a></dt> <dd>Antonio Banderas plays a Catholic priest who investigates a first-century corpse that bears a remarkable resemblance to You-Know-Who. The film is &#8220;remains shallow in its exploration and eventual affirmation of the resurrection.&#8221;</dd> <dt><a href="http://www.usccb.org/movies/e/exorcistthe1974.htm">The Exorcist</a></dt> <dd>&#8220;[T]he movie is on shaky ground theologically and its special effects are horrific but the result is an exciting horror fantasy for those with strong stomachs.&#8221;</dd> <dt><a href="http://www.usccb.org/movies/f/flawless1999.htm">Flawless</a></dt> <dd>A homophobe with a stroke gets speech therapy from a drag queen in a movie with &#8220;ambiguous depiction of gay lifestyles&#8221;.</dd> <dt><a href="http://www.usccb.org/movies/g/godfatherpartiiithe1990.htm">The Godfather, Part III</a></dt> <dd>This sequel, unlike the first two films in the series, loses points for &#8220;an unedifying ficitional depiction of some religious figures&#8221;.</dd> <dt><a href="http://www.usccb.org/movies/p/philadelphia1993.htm">Philadelphia</a></dt> <dd>A gay lawyer with AIDS sues his former employer for discrimination. &#8220;[T]he emotionally manipulative script and Hanks&#8217; restrained, powerful performance reduce complex social issues to the personal level of one victim&#8217;s humanity and search for justice. Sympathetic depiction of gay relationships, fleeting nudity and a few sexist and sexual slurs.&#8221;</dd> </dl> <p>The USCCB rates the following movies as &#8220;O&#8221;, meaning that they are &#8220;morally offensive&#8221;:</p> <dl> <dt><a href="http://www.usccb.org/movies/d/dogma.htm">Dogma</a></dt> <dd>Lisa Fiorentino plays the last known descendant of Jesus, working at an abortion clinic; Chris Rock plays Rufus, the black apostle; Matt Damon and Ben Affleck play fallen angels; Alanis Morisette plays God. &#8220;The unfunny proceedings rely on a mindless mix of irreverence and absurdity in poking fun at biblical characters and Christian stereotypes.&#8221;</dd> <dt><a href="http://www.usccb.org/movies/h/hailmary1985.htm">Hail Mary</a></dt> <dd>A modernized story of the Incarnation and Virgin Birth, whose &#8220;extensive use of nudity and extremely rough language in a context so sacred to Christians will be offensive to many.&#8221;</dd> <dt><a href="http://www.usccb.org/movies/l/lasttemptationofchristthe1988.htm">The Last Temptation of Christ</a></dt> <dd>Satan tempts Jesus by holding out the prospect of a normal life off the cross. The movie &#8220;fails because of artistic inadequacy rather than anti-religious bias &#8230; insistence on gore and brutality <i>[sic!]</i>, as well as a preoccupation with sexual rather than spirtual love.&#8221;</dd> <dt><a href="http://www.usccb.org/movies/o/omenthe1976.htm">The Omen</a></dt> <dd>Gregory Peck is the foster father of the anti-Christ. The film&#8217;s &#8220;only interest in religion is in terms of its exploitation potential.&#8221;</dd> <dt><a href="http://www.usccb.org/movies/r/rapturethe1991.htm">The Rapture</a></dt> <dd>A woman joins an apocalyptic Christian sect. Then the Apocalypse happens. &#8220;Excessively graphic depictions of sexual encounters, eccentric interpretations of biblical texts and occasional rough language.&#8221;</dd> <dt><a href="http://www.usccb.org/movies/r/rosemarysbaby1968.htm">Rosemary&#8217;s Baby</a></dt> <dd>Mia Farrow discovers that she has been impregnated by Satan. &#8220;[T]he movie&#8217;s inverted Christian elements denigrate religious beliefs.&#8221;</dd> </dl> <p class="via"><cite>Passion</cite> review via <a href="http://uggabugga.blogspot.com/2004_02_22_uggabugga_archive.html#107781692985752358">Uggabugga</a></p></p>
