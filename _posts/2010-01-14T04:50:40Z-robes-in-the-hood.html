<p>The Harry Potter series was partly inspired by a peculiarly British literary genre: stories of boys&#8217; adventures in public<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/#fn4434738804b4ea5932286a">1</a></sup> school. If J. K.&nbsp;Rowling had been American, perhaps she would have been inspired by a peculiarly American sort of educational drama, and come up with <a href="http://www.collegehumor.com/video:1925557">this</a>.</p>

	<p class="fn" id="fn4434738804b4ea5932286a"><sup>1</sup> George Bernard Shaw once remarked that the US and Britain are two nations separated by a common language. A British &#8220;public&#8221; school is an American &#8220;elite private&#8221; school. Also, a British &#8220;boot&#8221; of a car is an American &#8220;trunk&#8221;, British &#8220;trainers&#8221; are American &#8220;sneakers&#8221;, and a British &#8220;hat&#8221; is American &#8220;underpants&#8221;. OK, I made that last one up.</p>
