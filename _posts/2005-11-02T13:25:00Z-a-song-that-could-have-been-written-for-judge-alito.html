Matheson</cite>, which required <b>parental</b> notice prior to any abortion on an <b>unemancipated minor</b>. Instead, she has stated that this statute merely inhibited abortions to &#8216;some degree.&#8217; In dissent in Matheson, Justice Marshall argued that the statute would result in substantial interference with abortions sought by minors. He wrote that &#8216;the minor may confront physical or emotional abuse, withdrawal of financial support or actual obstruction of the abortion decision.&#8217; These harms are almost identical to those that the majority in this case attributes to Section 3209 [the Pennsylvania law requiring a <b>married woman</b> seeking an abortion to notify her <b>husband</b>].&#8221; <a href="http://www.confirmthem.com/?p=1764#comment-62642">(Alito&#8217;s 3rd&nbsp;Circuit dissent in <i>Planned Parenthood v.

These exceptions apply if a woman certifies that she has not notified her husband because she believes that (1) he is not the father of the child, (2) he cannot be found after diligent effort, (3) the pregnancy is the result of a spousal sexual assault that has been reported to the authorities, or (4) she has reason to believe that notification is likely to result in the infliction of bodily injury upon her&#8230;. Of the potentially affected women who could not invoke an exception, it seems safe to assume that some percentage, despite an initial inclination not to tell their husbands, would notify their husbands without suffering substantial ill effects.&#8221; <a href="http://www.confirmthem.com/?p=1764#comment-62642"><i>(Planned Parenthood v.

For example, Congress did not find that public employers refused to permit as much sick leave as the FMLA mandates with the intent of disadvantaging employees of one gender&#8230;. Moreover, even if there were relevant findings or evidence, the FMLA provisions at issue here would not be congruent or proportional. Unlike the Equal Protection Clause, which the FMLA is said to enforce, the FMLA does much more than require nondiscriminatory sick leave practices; it creates a substantive entitlement to sick leave.&#8221; (<a href="http://laws.lp.findlaw.com/3rd/003140.html">Chittister v.

The plaintiffs, however, do not appear to have offered any evidence showing how many (or indeed that any actual women) would be affected by this asserted imperfection in the statute&#8230;. The plaintiffs offered evidence that &#8216;mere notification of pregnancy is frequently a flashpoint for battering&#8217;. This proof indicates when violence is likely to occur in an abusive marriage but provides no basis for determining how many women would be adversely affected by Section 3209.&#8221; <a href="http://www.confirmthem.com/?p=1764#comment-62642"><i>(Planned Parenthood v.
