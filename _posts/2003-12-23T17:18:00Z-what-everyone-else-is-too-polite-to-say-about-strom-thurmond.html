<p>Take it away, <a href="http://www.alltooflat.com/about/personal/sean/?BlogNum=523">Sean Collins</a>: <blockquote>The revelation of Thurmond&#8217;s fathering a child with a black woman makes him even more loathsome in my eyes, if that&#8217;s possible; to him, black people may not have been good enough to go to the same schools or eat at the same counters or drink from the same water fountains and probably even to vote, if that were possible, but they were good enough to fuck and then discard.</blockquote> <p class="via">via <a href="http://www.highclearing.com/archivesuo/week_2003_12_14.html#004820">Unqualified Offerings</a></p></p>
