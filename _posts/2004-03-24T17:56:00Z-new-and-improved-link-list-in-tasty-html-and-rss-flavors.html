<p>I&#8217;ve set up an account with <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a>, a &#8220;social bookmarks manager,&#8221; and set up the blog to include <a href="http://del.icio.us/sethg">my most recent del.icio.us postings</a> in the upper right. When I have enough of those, I&#8217;ll comment out the code for my old sideblog. <p>The good part of this service: del.icio.us generates <a href="http://del.icio.us/rss/sethg">an RSS feed</a> for my list-o&#8217;-links, so I don&#8217;t have to hack the sideblog module to add that feature. The bad part: there&#8217;s no support for a &#8220;via&#8221; link to give credit to someone else for finding a page, and the fellow running the site seems <a href="http://lists.burri.to/pipermail/delicious-discuss/2004-March/000157.html">philosophically opposed</a> to adding that feature. But until I write my own PipeDreamBlog software to include every feature <em>I</em> think is important for a weblog to have, this should serve me nicely.</p> <p>If you have your own del.icio.us account, or are inspired to <a href="http://del.icio.us/register">create one</a> (it&#8217;s free!), please let me know about it, so I can add its feed to <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/public/sethg">my own aggregator</a>.</p></p>
