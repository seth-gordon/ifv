<p>In Genesis 25:6, it says, &#8220;to the sons of Abraham&#8217;s concubines, he gave gifts.&#8221; My wife pointed out a Rashi on this verse, saying that these gifts were <i>shem tum&#8217;ah</i>, &#8220;impure names&#8221; that could be used for sorcery. Gur Aryeh (cited in the ever-helpful Reb Footnote) explains where the rabbis got this idea: since the previous verse reported that Abraham gave Isaac everything he owned, the concubines could not have received any <em>physical</em> gifts from Abraham. <p>The Gur Aryeh sounds very much like those people who say that you&#8217;re not really stealing from musicians when you download MP3s off the Internet, since nobody is being deprived of any physical property. I suppose that in Abraham&#8217;s time, they did not have a concept of &#8220;intellectual property.&#8221; Or if they did, it didn&#8217;t apply to kabbalistic formulas.</p></p>
