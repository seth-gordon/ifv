<p>Little zombies on the hillside<br />
Little zombies eating human brains<br />
Little zombies on the hillside<br />
Little zombies all the same<br />
There&#8217;s a green one and a pink one<br />
And a blue one and a yellow one<br />
And they&#8217;re all busy eating human brains<br />
And they all look just the same.</p>
