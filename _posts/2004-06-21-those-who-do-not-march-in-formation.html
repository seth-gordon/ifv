<p>The parsha of <i>Beha`alotekha</i> begins with details about the special duties of the tribe of Levi (Numbers 8). A little later, it describes how the tribes marched in formation (10:11&#8211;28). Then, there is the conversation between Moses and Chovev (a.k.a. Jethro), where the latter, despite Moses&#8217; urgings, decides to go home to his own family. A few verses after that, we have the episode with the quail, which begins as follows: &#8220;The <i>afsafsuf</i> in their midst had a great craving, and even the Israelites sat and cried, &#8216;Who will give us meat?&#8217;&#8221; (11:4). <p>The commentators agree that the <i>afsafsuf</i> here is the <i>`erev rav</i>, the &#8220;mixed multitude,&#8221; that left Egypt alongside the descendants of Jacob (Exodus 12:38). What do these people have in common with Jethro? <em>They did not belong to any tribe,</em> and the pageant described in the preceding chapters does not define any role for them.</p> <p>It can&#8217;t be a coincidence that the <i>`erev rav</i> started causing trouble so soon after the most prominent local convert took his leave, can it? My wife suggests two possible reasons:</p> <ol> <li>Jethro was a role model and leader for the <i>`erev rav</i>, and once he left, rowdier elements of the group took over.</li> <li>The native-born Jews in the desert were becoming less friendly to converts; Jethro dealt with the changed attitude by politely taking his leave, and the <i>`erev rav</i> dealt with it by becoming more militant.</li> </ol></p>
