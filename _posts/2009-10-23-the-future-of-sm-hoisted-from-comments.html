<p>rm <a href="http://rm.livejournal.com/1735276.html">linked</a> to a <span class="caps">NYT</span> article on how <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/22/fashion/22yell.html?pagewanted=all">shouting is the new spanking</a>, i.e., parents who diligently avoid hitting their kids are feeling guilty that they can&#8217;t also keep from yelling at them.</p>

	<p>One of her commenters <a href="http://rm.livejournal.com/1735276.html?thread=16330092#t16330092">wondered</a> if, now that spanking children is less common, the next generation of adults will be less likely to have a kink for being spanked.</p>

	<p>This led me to imagine an S/M scene where the dom says, with a cold and stern voice, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to <em>count to three</em>, and by the time I reach three, you had better be <em>naked</em>, or there will be <em>consequences</em>&#8230;.&#8221;</p>

	<p>(That &#8220;one minute per year of age&#8221; rule for time-out really sucks when you&#8217;re 35 years old, doesn&#8217;t it?)</p>
