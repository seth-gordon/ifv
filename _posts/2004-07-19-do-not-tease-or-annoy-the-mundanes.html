<p>The <a href="http://mos.org">Science Museum</a> is putting on <a href="http://www.mos.org/lotr">an exhibition tied to <cite>The Lord of the Rings</cite> movies</a>. The front page of the exhibit&#8217;s brochure-site warns: &#8220;&#8230;for the safety and comfort of all visitors, no weaponry associated with the films&#8217; characters will be allowed in the exhibition.&#8221; <p>Does this mean that you can&#8217;t bring your <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/archives/001328.html">Ring</a> into the exhibition?</p></p>
