<p>O ye celebrants of <a href="http://www.talklikeshakespeare.org/">Talk Like Shakespeare Day</a>, commit not murder most foul against the Queen&#8217;s English, and remember the following oft-neglected points:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Contrary to that Web site&#8217;s counsel, &#8220;thou&#8221; is the pronoun for the singular second-person <em>nominative</em> case (“<b>Thou</b> art a fool&#8221;) and &#8220;thee&#8221; is the <em>objective</em> case (&#8220;She hath made a fool of <b>thee</b>”).</li>
		<li>&#8220;Wherefore&#8221; is no synonym for &#8220;where&#8221;, but rather, &#8220;why&#8221;. When Juliet asks &#8220;wherefore art thou Romeo&#8221;, she seeks not his current address.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>God bless us, every one.  (Whoops. Wrong century.)</p>
