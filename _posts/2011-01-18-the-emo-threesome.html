<p>After watching <i>Buffy</i> on <span class="caps">DVD</span>, years after all of my friends had seen it on the network, and watching <i>Babylon 5</i> on tape, and watching <i>Big Love</i> on <span class="caps">DVD</span>, and watching <i>Firefly</i> on <span class="caps">DVD</span>, and&#8230; well, every once in a while I hear that some new show is going to be premiered, and I think, aha, <em>this one</em> I will see from the beginning, so I can be a first-class member of its fan community.</p>

	<p>So I just saw the premiere of <a href="http://www.syfy.com/beinghuman/">Being Human</a> and&#8230; well, it ended on a cliffhanger and I am not rearranging my schedule to see the second episode.</p>

	<p>The main reason that <i>Buffy</i>, <i>B5</i>, etc. make for such good drama is that their protagonists actually have <em>passions</em>.  That&#8217;s what the &#8220;pro&#8221; in &#8220;protagonist&#8221; means, right? The protagonist <em>wants</em> something, and isn&#8217;t satisfied by just going through the motions of desire. <i>BH</i> had an hour to establish the motivations of its characters, and defines them in terms of what they are <em>avoiding</em>, not what they seek. The emo-pire doesn&#8217;t want to feed off live humans. The emo-wolf doesn&#8217;t want his relatives to know that he&#8217;s a werewolf.<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/#fn1798396004d3524715635c">1</a></sup> The emo-ghost doesn&#8217;t want to leave her ludicrously underpriced two-story apartment.<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/#fn3792984554d35247156745">2</a></sup></p>

	<p>Even the episode&#8217;s bad guy, über-vamp sire of emo-pire, is weak: a vampire patriarch who has apparently read too many <a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/">Dr. Sears</a> books. There&#8217;s one scene where the emo-pire, who has been trying to claim that he is out of the whole predation scene, asks his sire for a significant favor, and the sire just <em>grants</em> it, without even a suggestion of &#8220;you owe me and you can be damn sure I will come back to collect on your debt&#8221;. If Vito Corelone had run his family this way, they wouldn’t have been able to take over a Rotary Club.</p>

	<p>I don&#8217;t expect High Art from Hollywood, but sheesh, is a little <em>storytelling</em> too much to ask for?</p>

	<p class="fn" id="fn1798396004d3524715635c"><sup>1</sup> The protagonists of <i>Big Love</i>, in the first few seasons, don&#8217;t want their neighbors to know they are polygamous&#8212;life in the closet, and the effects thereof, is a running theme&#8212;but that avoidance does not define them. They want to live as a family <em>and</em> maintain a lifestyle that resembles the middle-class <span class="caps">LDS</span> ideal <em>while</em> staying closeted.</p>

	<p class="fn" id="fn3792984554d35247156745"><sup>2</sup> The apartment is in a Boston neighborhood that my wife guessed as the South End, and the paying tenants are a hospital nurse and an orderly. I have an easier time suspending my disbelief in vampires.</p>
