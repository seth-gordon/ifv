<p>If you have committed an offense against someone else, even if you have already paid them whatever monetary damages you owe, you don&#8217;t get forgiveness from Above until you&#8217;ve asked your victim to forgive you. The Mishnah (<i>Bava Kamma</i> 8:7) derives this principle from the story of Abraham and Avimelekh; after Avimelekh has taken Abraham&#8217;s wife for himself (after that whole &#8220;she is my sister&#8221; thing, which we won&#8217;t go into here), God tells Avimelekh (Genesis 20:7), &#8220;now, return the wife of that woman, because he is a prophet, and he will pray for you.&#8221; <p>A commentary on the <i>Shulkhan `Arukh</i> (<i>Me&#8217;irat `Einim, Choshen Mishpat</i> 422:1) takes this argument a step further. You shouldn&#8217;t just get your victim to <em>forgive</em> you &#8212; you should patch up your relationship with your victim to the point where he or she would be willing to <em>pray on your behalf.</em></p> <p>May you all be inscribed and sealed for a happy and prosperous year.</p></p>
