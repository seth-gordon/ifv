<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/31/books/31babysitters.html?_r=2&amp;hp=&amp;pagewanted=all">According to the <i><span class="caps">NYT</span></i></a>, Scholastic is reissuing its <i>Baby-Sitters Club</i> series, a line of novels for tween girls that ran for 213 titles and sold 176 million copies. Girls who devoured these books during the 1980s and 1990s now have children of their own and, as one bookseller put it, the rebooted series would sell “really well to the girls who aren’t quite ready for vampires and particularly to the parents of the girls who aren’t quite ready.”</p>

	<p>I see some great potential for crossover fanfic here.</p>
