<p>(Let&#8217;s see if I&#8217;m sufficiently recovered from chagim-plus-new-baby to get back to blogging&#8230;)</p>
	<p>We&#8217;re trying to reintroduce the baby to bottle-feeding, and we were wondering if he&#8217;d be more likely to suck on a different kind of nipple.  So I did an amazon.com search for &#8220;nipple&#8221; and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nearly-Me-Gaff-17-400-Nude/dp/B0001ZO45Q/sr=8-2/qid=1163384314/ref=pd_bbs_2/002-0356342-6996827?ie=UTF8&#38;s=apparel">this</a> (warning: <acronym title="not very safe for work">NVSFW</acronym>) came up second in the results.</p>
	<p>I am amused by the contrast between the &#8220;Product Description&#8221; section and the &#8220;Customers who bought this item also bought&#8221; section.  Somebody should tell the vendor that there&#8217;s really no point to being coy about who their customers are.</p>
