<p>I&#8217;ve seen a lot of opinions flying around Left Blogistan about what the Israeli government and/or Hamas <em>should have</em> done to prevent this carnage.  In one sense, I agree with all of it; in another sense, I find it depressingly academic. <a href="http://osewalrus.livejournal.com/431493.html">As osewalrus elucidates</a>, leaders on both sides who chose to escalate made decisions that were perfectly rational <em>in the short term</em>. Neither side&#8217;s leadership is in a position to tell its constituents &#8220;I know this concession makes you feel like suckers, but trust me, if we stick it out for another year we will all benefit&#8221;, because before that year is up, the leaders can be replaced (or assassinated), or the other side can find some excuse for not making a reciprocal concession, or rogue elements can go out and make their own war. You might as well wish for a Middle East populated entirely by Jewish and Arab liberal intellectuals, whose representatives, elected by two-thirds majorities, could work out a comprehensive final settlement over coffee in an afternoon. And a pony.</p>
