<p>It&#8217;s like <cite>Joan of Arcadia</cite> meets <cite>Joe Millionaire</cite>. You&#8217;ve got twelve people at a retreat center, out in the woods somewhere. Six of them are looking for some kind of spiritual direction in their lives, but aren&#8217;t sure what religion to follow. Six of them are spiritual guides representing a variety of religions: one Catholic priest, one Baptist, one Chassidic rabbi, and so on. <p>But here&#8217;s the catch: three of the six spiritual guides are atheists <em>pretending to be</em> religious. At the end of the series, each one of our lost souls has to choose which religion, out of the six represented by the guides, he or she wants to investigate further. Every atheist whose pretended religion gets picked wins a million dollars for each soul he or she wins over.</p></p>
