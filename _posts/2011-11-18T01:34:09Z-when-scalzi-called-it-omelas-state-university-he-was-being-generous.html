<p>A columnist for <i>The Nation</i> <a href="http://www.thenation.com/blog/164587/world-joe-paterno-made">quotes</a> a Penn State student defending Joe Paterno, the football coach who allegedly shielded a child rapist from the law:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>If not for Paterno…Pennsylvania State might still be an agriculture school and [the city of] State College might be lucky if there were a Wal-Mart within a 30-mile radius.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>To paraphrase <i>A Man For All Seasons</i>: it profits a man nothing to give his soul for the whole world. But for a Wal-Mart?</p>
