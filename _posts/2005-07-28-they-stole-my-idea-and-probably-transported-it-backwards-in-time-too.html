<p>For a while, I&#8217;ve had this idea kicking around my head for a different kind of online dating service, but I haven&#8217;t had the Copious Free Time to implement it. Now I don&#8217;t have to, because the people behind <a href="http://okcupid.com/" target="_blank" class="blines3" title="Link outside of this blog">OkCupid</a> had a similar idea, only they had more Copious Free Time (if I had sold two Web sites to Barnes and Noble, I&#8217;d have more Copious Free Time, too), and two of them are Real Mathematicians, which means they are using <a href="http://okcupid.com/static?p=faaaq" target="_blank" class="blines3" title="Link outside of this blog">statistical matching techniques</a> that I wouldn&#8217;t have even tried to implement.</p> <p>If you&#8217;ve used this service, I&#8217;d be interested in hearing your evaluation of it, so I can find out how good my idea was.</p>
