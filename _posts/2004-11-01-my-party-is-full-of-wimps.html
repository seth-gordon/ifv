<p>For the past year, cynical Democrats have anticipated that Karl Rove, evil genius that he is, would lock up the election with an &#8220;October surprise&#8221; to push up Bush&#8217;s approval ratings and win the election. The most popular October-suprise theory predicted a conveniently-timed announcement of Osama bin&nbsp;Laden&#8217;s death or capture. Surely, the cynics said, that dastardly Bush Administration has Osama locked up already, waiting to be unveiled at the most dramatic possible moment.</p> <p>And then, on Friday, we had our surprise: a video of a tanned, well-rested, statesmanlike fugitive declaring, <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/79C6AF22-98FB-4A1C-B21F-2BC36E87F61F.htm">&#8220;We&#8217;re at war, and because Allah has granted you an incompetent Commander-in-Chief, I&#8217;m winning. I&#8217;m Osama bin&nbsp;Laden and I approved this message.&#8221;</a> This, after two <em>other</em> surprises that only a wing-nut could spin as good news for the Bush campaign: the flu-vaccine shortage and the vanishing al&nbsp;Qaaqaa explosives.</p> <p>Yet Joshua Micah Marshall, a blogger who used to work for Clinton&#8212;and therefore, I assume, has plenty of connections among other Democratic wonks&#8212;<a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/week_2004_10_24.php#003851">reported</a> that on the emails he received after the tape was released, &#8220;the opinions ranged the gamut, from panic to indifference&#8230;&#8221; He also bemoaned Democrats&#8217; &#8220;tendency to fret that all is lost, almost to <em>indulge</em> in it, when the car hits a simple bump in the road.&#8221;</p> <p>Panic? Bump in the road?!</p> <p>Is there something in the DC drinking water that makes Democrats afraid of their own shadows? Sheesh!</p>
