<p>Excerpt from an article in Sunday&#8217;s <cite>Boston Globe Magazine</cite>, in which the reporter talks to an anonymous official of the Coalition Provisional Authority: <blockquote> <p>&#8220;Of course, we are an empire, but we are different,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Our empire is not defined by territorial ambitions but by ideas. A lot of ideas, like free trade, like democracy, like copyright laws.&#8221;</p> <p>Copyright? Was my host really suggesting that we had carried out one of the largest land invasions since World War II to protect copyright laws?</p> <p>&#8220;Well, yeah, our empire is about promoting free trade, it&#8217;s about promoting democracy and the ownership of ideas. Sure, it&#8217;s about McDonald&#8217;s and Microsoft and everything else. But the reality is we are not here only to do that. We are here to protect the security of America. That&#8217;s what the mission is about.</p> <p>&#8220;That, and to help the Iraqi people build their own future,&#8221; he adds.</p> </blockquote> <p>Oh. OK. Thanks for clearing that up, sir.</p> <p>Proposed new antiwar slogan: &#8220;No blood for Microsoft!&#8221;</p></p>
