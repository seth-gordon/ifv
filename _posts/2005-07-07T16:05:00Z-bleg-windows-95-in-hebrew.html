<p>For my job, I obtained a six-year-old Israeli telephone directory on CD-ROM. (Why six years old? Because now that Bezeq has its directory on the Web, there&#8217;s no market for Israeli phone books on CD-ROM. Why don&#8217;t I just use Bezeq&#8217;s Web page? Because I don&#8217;t really care about looking up phone numbers&#8212;I&#8217;m trying to dump all the names in the directory.)</p> <p>The program was written for Windows 95, but all I have here is XP. If I try to run the program&#8212;even in compatibility mode&#8212;it gives the error message &#8220;Cannot find BIDI.DLL&#8221;. I assume that this DLL was distributed with Hebrew and Arabic versions of Windows 95.</p> <p>So does anyone out there have a Hebrew version of Windows 95, with all the appropriate licensing paperwork, that they&#8217;re willing to give or sell to me?</p>
