<p>The Talmud records the following deep philosophical debate:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>For two and a half years, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel had an argument.  These said: It would have been better if man had not been created.  These said: It is better that man has been created.  They put it to a vote and decided: It would have been better if man had not been created, but now that he has been created, let him examine his deeds.</p><p class="via">Eruvin 13b</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>This passage, I assume, is the inspiration for a classic Jewish joke:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>It would be better never to have been born. But who among us has such luck? One in a thousand, perhaps.</p>
	</blockquote>
