<p>Siri, the virtual personal assistant that comes with the new iPhone 4S, is <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/siri-faq.html">advertised</a> to understand English as she is spoke in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Somebody forgot to tell Appleâ€™s engineers that Scotland is part of the United Kingdom, so the poor electronic lass is mistaking &#8220;cheers&#8221; for &#8220;chairs&#8221;&#8230; and <a href="http://idealab.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/10/scottish-accents-foil-iphone-4s-siri.php?ref=fpb">worse</a>.</p>

	<p>They really should have seen this coming.</p>
