<p><a href="http://www.matthewyglesias.com/archives/week_2004_06_13.html#003573">Matthew Yglesias</a> responds to the <a href="http://volokh.com/archives/archive_2004_06_14.shtml#1087341740">laments</a> of his <a href="http://www.andrewsullivan.com/index.php?dish_inc=archives/2004_06_13_dish_archive.html#108744638028460678">elders</a> regarding slovenly men: <blockquote>Free marketers like Sullivan and Volokh are too blinded by ideology to see the compelling need for government intervention. A temporary regulatory solution could help us resolve this mess. For the next five years, say, straight women must &#8220;insist on only dating hot guys&#8221; (we&#8217;ll have to empanel a &#8220;Federal Hot Guy Commission&#8221; consisting of &#8220;shallow, beauty-obsessed [gay] males&#8221; to rank everyone) and see if the hot guy supply increases in response.</blockquote> For shame, Matt. What kind of liberal asks the government to stick its nose into the little black books of its citizens, when good old-fashioned <a href="http://ropine.com/abc/beauty.html">taxing and spending</a> can yield the same results? <p class="via">see also <a href="http://examinedlife.typepad.com/johnbelle/2004/06/mysteries_of_ma.html">Belle Waring</a> and <a href="http://www.pandagon.net/mtarchives/002564.html">Ezra Klein</a></p></p>
