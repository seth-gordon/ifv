<p>My wife has called my attention to <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2004/09/12/pope_bishops_discuss_abuses/">an article in yesterday&#8217;s <cite>Boston Globe</cite></a> (the link will probably be dead tomorrow) with the following headline and subhead: <hr> <p style="text-align: center"><b>Pope, bishops discuss abuses</b><br />
 <i>US leaders urged to embrace flock</i></p> <hr> <p>Quoth Jen, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t that what got them into trouble in the first place?&#8221;</p></p>
