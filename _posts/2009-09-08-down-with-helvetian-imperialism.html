<p>One of my pet peeves about discussion of Israel among left-wingers is the prevalence of the idea that the Jewish state is an illegitimate entity that should be eliminated, not just compelled to yield territory to a Palestinian state. Even if we assume for the purpose of argument that every complaint about the morality of Zionism is true, it would prove that Israel as a nation-state is born in sin, as it were&#8212;and similar complaints can be made about every other nation-state on this planet. (If you say &#8220;all those other countries committed their founding war crimes long long ago, before the international community even recognized them as such,&#8221; then I will respond with one word: &#8220;Serbia&#8221;.)</p>

	<p>So I guess I have to give props to Muammar Abu Minyar al-Gaddafi, Revolutionary Leader of the Great Socialist People&#8217;s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, for his proposal to <a href="http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/news_digest/Libyan_anti_Swiss_motion_rejected.html?siteSect=104&amp;sid=11162783&amp;cKey=1252038089000&amp;ty=nd">break up Switzerland</a>:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Gaddafi first mentioned the idea of dismemberment during the G8 summit in Italy in July. Switzerland &#8220;is a world mafia and not a state&#8221;, he said, adding that it was &#8220;formed of an Italian community that should return to Italy, another German community that should return to Germany, and a third French community that should return to France&#8221;.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Note that Gaddafi has also endorsed <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/22/opinion/22qaddafi.html?_r=1&amp;ref=opinion">a single binational Jewish-Arab state in Palestine</a> rather than the status quo or a two-state solution.</p>
