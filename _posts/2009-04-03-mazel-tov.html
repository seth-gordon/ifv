<p>As a resident of Massachusetts, I am proud to welcome the state of Iowa into the <a href="http://ckd.livejournal.com/62335.html">Equal Protection Under The Law Club</a>. This is a rather exclusive club right now, but I have every reason to expect that over the next decade, it will become less so. Furthermore, since Iowa, unlike California, has a sober and deliberative process for amending its state constitution, I have every reason to expect that the backlash against its supreme court&#8217;s decision can be restrained before the voters do something that their descendants will be ashamed of.</p>
