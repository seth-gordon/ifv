<p>Nineteen <a href="http://www.3nov.com/theses.html">November 3rd Theses</a> on the way forward for the Democrats. Highlights:</p> <blockquote> <p>The 2004 presidential election was not lost by John Kerry over the last several months but by the Democratic Party over the last several decades&#8230;</p> <p>Renovating Democratic politics is not a question of moving to the right or talking more about G&#8211;d. It is about creating a framework that once again communicates to the core needs of the American people.</p> <p>Returning the Democratic Party to majority status will require a political realignment no less sweeping than that which was accomplished by conservatives over the last 40 years.</p> <p>Candidates who intend to win should no longer hire consultants who repeatedly lose&#8230;</p> </blockquote> Hell, I&#8217;ve transcribed enough; just follow the link and read the whole thing.
