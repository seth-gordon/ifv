<p>It appears that some Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza are so confident of victory over the Israeli Defense Forces that they are taking on an even more formidable enemy: the Motion Picture Association of America. To quote their <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=SVBIZINK2.story&STORY=/www/story/08-19-2003/0002003023&EDATE=TUE+Aug+19+2003,+06:14+AM">press release</a>: <blockquote>Earthstation 5 is at war with the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) and the Record Association of America (RIAA), and to make our point very clear that their governing laws and policys [sic] have absolutely no meaning to us here in Palestine, we will continue to add even more movies for FREE.</blockquote> <p>I&#8217;ve never heard of &#8220;Earthstation 5&#8221; before, but I&#8217;m impressed with how customer-focused this document is. It&#8217;s more readable and fact-filled than most of the other press releases that I&#8217;ve seen, and their president resisted the urge to make some snarky comment about Hollywood being controlled by Jews. The release even boasts of &#8220;FREE ten SEX channels&#8221; &#8212; shouldn&#8217;t Islamic Jihad do something about that?</p> <p><a href="http://www.livejournal.com/~gnomi">Nomi</a> keeps telling us that we should watch <cite>Salach Shabbati</cite>, an Israeli comedy about the travails of a Sephardic immigrant, but our local video stores and Netflix don&#8217;t carry it. Do you think someone in Jenin has a tape that they&#8217;re willing to share?</p> <p class="via">via <a href="http://thelookingglass.blogspot.com/">The Looking Glass</a></p></p>
