<p>[Updated: Minor edits.] <p>Due to an accident involving a black hole, the National Reconnaisance Office, and the Verizon Wireless switching network, I found myself talking on my cell phone with my great-great-granddaughter, Chayya Mushka Sunshine Gordon. As soon as I realized that I was hearing a voice from a century in the future, I wanted to ask her for the point spread on next year&#8217;s Super Bowl, but forced myself to make some small talk first.</p> <p>&#8220;So what do you do?&#8221; I asked.</p> <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a computer programmer. My company develops networked applications for intelligent textiles.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Cool! That&#8217;s what I do, too.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;They had intelligent textiles in 2004?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;No. I mean, I&#8217;m a programmer.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Oh.&#8221; I could hear the wrinkled nose in her voice. In the background, a bus door opened and closed, and other passengers babbled to each other. &#8220;What&#8217;s it like, being a male programmer?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;You might as well ask what it&#8217;s like to drive a car with an internal-combustion engine. Most of the programmers I know are men.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said, without the wrinkle this time.</p> <p>&#8220;Do IT managers in 2104 discriminate against men?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Sex discrimination is illegal nowadays. It&#8217;s just that men don&#8217;t have, you know, the temprament, the right way of thinking, to be good programmers.&#8221; Her tone became more animated. &#8220;Where I used to work, there was a man on my team responsible for the database design, and it was the most <em>incredible</em> mess. To do the simplest thing, I had to spend days trying to figure out where the information was, or how to add something to one table without screwing up five others. I was venting about it to a friend of mine, and she said, &#8216;If you can&#8217;t get a man to put the toilet seat down, how can you expect him to normalize a database schema?&#8217; &#8212;No offense.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;None taken.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;So most of the programmers in the 20th century were men? No wonder they had so much buggy software. Why didn&#8217;t women look for programming jobs? Discrimination?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;I assume that&#8217;s one of the reasons. Also, I suspect a lot of girls were turned off to computer classes because they associated programming with math.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;<em>Math?!</em> You have to make up your algorithms and data structures from scratch and prove that they work?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Most programmers haven&#8217;t had to deal with that kind of thing since the 1970s, at least. But the news hasn&#8217;t filtered down to the sixth-graders yet.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just crazy! Programming is all about <em>communication</em>. You have to communicate with the customer to learn about the problem they want to solve, with your co-workers to make sure that all the pieces will building will work together, with the programmers who come after you so they&#8217;ll be able to maintain what you did&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Oh, absolutely.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;And women have always been the communicators in society. That&#8217;s why men always tease us for talking so much. That&#8217;s why women have always been concentrated in jobs that involve communication: teaching, library science, human resources, secretarial work&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>I cleared my throat. &#8220;Funny you should say that about secretaries&#8212;&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Oy, I have to go.&#8221; The doors opened again. &#8220;It&#8217;s been great talking to you, but I have to get to my other job now.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Other job?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;I work the second shift at the Holiday Inn reception desk. You don&#8217;t think I could pay the rent on a <em>programmer&#8217;s</em> salary, did you?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Some things never change, I guess.&#8221;</p></p>
