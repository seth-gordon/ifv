<p>A professional gambler is not allowed to be a witness before a Jewish religious court, because the Sages declared this practice to be a form of theft. The explanation that I&#8217;ve heard (I assume this is somewhere in the Talmud, but I don&#8217;t have time now to look for a citation) is that when you lay down money at a game of chance, you are not actually willing to lose it. Without that intention, the flow of money from the loser to the winner is morally tainted. The loser isn&#8217;t getting anything in exchange for the money that&#8217;s gone, and certainly didn&#8217;t intend it to be a gift.</p>
	<p>(OK, some people who gamble are happy to give up a certain amount of cash in exchange for the thrill of the game, but those aren&#8217;t the people who keep casinos in business.) </p>
	<p>Cf. <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2006/08/22/for_many_on_campuses_trouble_is_in_the_cards/?page=full">this <em>Globe</em> article on college students and online poker</a> (that page will <strike>self-destruct</strike> vanish behind the paywall in 48 hours), which quotes one college junior as saying: &#8220;When I&#8217;m down just $100, I feel, oh, I just took a $100 bill out of my pocket and handed it to someone. Your tendency is to want to win it back.&#8221; </p>
