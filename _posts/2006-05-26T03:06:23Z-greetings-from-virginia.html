<p>If you can see this (and the domain name in your browser doesn&#8217;t begin with &#8220;groundcherry&#8221;), then your DNS client can see ropine.com at its new IP address, which points to a virtual server run by the nice folks at <a href="http://openhosting.com/home">OpenHosting</a>.</p>
	<p>There is a certain cachet to being able to tell people &#8220;go to this URL and you will see a Web page served from a computer that is <em>in my basement</em>&#8221;, but it&#8217;s not worth the tzuris of losing a long weekend&#8217;s worth of hits, or more, when the server flakes out and I can&#8217;t go down to that basement and fix it right away.</p>
	<p>Also, it turns out that it will cost <em>less</em> for me to get a virtual server at OpenHosting (where I am still root within my sandbox) plus a standard DSL service for home (the kind that doesn&#8217;t let me run a server), than it&#8217;s costing me now to have a static IP address (the kind that <em>does</em> let me run a server in my basement) through <a href="http://speakeasy.net">Speakeasy</a>.</p>
	<p>(If you <em>do</em> want to host a Web server in your basement, or have some other reason to want a geek-friendly ISP, we heartily recommend Speakeasy. We have no complaints about the service they&#8217;ve given us; it&#8217;s just that we&#8217;re moving on to a different kind of service.)</p>
	<p>P.S.: Sorry for the hiatus; between Pesach, a string of illnesses in the nuclear family, and a string of visits to and from the extended family, blogging time has been, shall we say, constrained.</p>
	<p>P.P.S.: Happy third blogiversary to me!</p>
