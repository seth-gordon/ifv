<p>Several folks on my LJ friends list have mentioned <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/22/magazine/22yeshiva-t.html?ex=1342756800&#38;en=4c8b6294d973a829&#38;ei=5090&#38;partner=rssuserland&#38;emc=rss">this charming piece</a>, in which Noah Feldman, a <a href="http://www.maimonides.org/">Maimonides School</a> alumnus, reflects on his school experience and the &#8220;Modern Orthodox&#8221; community surrounding it.  I put scare quotes around &#8220;Modern Orthodox&#8221; because while he attributes certain attitudes to people he calls &#8220;Modern Orthodox&#8221;, and perhaps those people would call <em>themselves</em> &#8220;Modern Orthodox&#8221;, he does not mention the long string of Jewish thinkers, starting with Rabbi Samson Rafael Hirsch זצ״ל, who <em>defined</em> Modern Orthodox Judaism. Feldman refers to Senator Joe Lieberman; he refers to Rabbi Moshe Feinstein זצ״ל; he refers to Yigal Amir and Baruch Goldstein. But he never cites the life or works of Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik זצ״ל, the pre-eminent Modern Orthodox philosopher of the 20th century, who <em>founded of the Maimonides School</em> and who <em>was still alive while Feldman was a student there</em>. That should tell you something about the lens through which Feldman sees the Orthodox world.</p>
	<p>Feldman seems to believe that the most authentic expressions of Judaism are the most illiberal ones. Now, if <em>I</em> believed that, I would either join the charedi world, or I would never set foot in a synagogue again. But Feldman is married to a non-Jewish woman <em>and</em> takes his children to hear the Book of Esther read on Purim. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t everyone&#8217;s life a mass of contradictions?&#8221; he says.</p>
	<p>The &#8220;Modern Orthodox&#8221; community offends Feldman because instead of letting us all bask in postmodern &#8220;I am large, I contain multitudes&#8221; playfulness, it tries to <em>resolve</em> the contradictions. At Maimonides, learning the theory of evolution is OK, but marrying a non-Jew is not OK. The Maimonides approach is certainly open to critique. Different schools of Jewish thought (charedi Orthodox, classical Reform, etc.) can argue for different approaches to being a Jew in the 21st century. But Feldman does not have a school of thought; he has emotions that he treats as entitlements. It is not enough for him to marry a non-Jew and continue to feel connected with his Jewish upbringing; he wants his Orthodox alma mater to endorse his marriage. And so he does not <em>argue</em>; he <em>insinuates</em> that there is something false about Modern Orthodoxy, that instead of teaching Jews a way of <em>engaging</em> with the modern world, it teaches Jews to <em>disguise themselves</em> for the sake of getting along in that world.</p>
	<p>Feh.</p>
	<p>It&#8217;s bad enough that the most reactionary elements of the Jewish world have appointed themselves the final arbiters of my religion and have declared that my own community&#8217;s practice is, at best, Frumkeit Lite. But why do people with no interest in accepting &#8220;the yoke of the commandments&#8221; give the reactionaries the same license?</p>
