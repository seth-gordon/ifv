<p>According to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/financialtimes/business/FT1075982783472.html?ex=1393131600&en=84995e065fb67b58&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND">a recent study</a>, the personal stock portfolios of United States senators outperformed the market by an average of 12&nbsp;percent per year. (Republicans and Democrats performed equally well.) By comparison, senior executives outperform the market by 5&nbsp;percent, and the average share-holding household <em>under</em>performs the market by 1.44&nbsp;percent. <p>I&#8217;m still having trouble deciding whether to vote for Senator Kerry or Senator Edwards in next week&#8217;s Democratic primary. Perhaps one of these gentlemen could demonstrate his commitment to constituent service by e-mailing me a few stock tips.</p> <p class="via">via <a href="http://www.calpundit.com/archives/003359.html">Calpundit</a></p></p>
