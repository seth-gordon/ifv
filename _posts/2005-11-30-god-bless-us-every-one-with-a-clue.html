<p>Rabbi <i>[sic]</i> Aryeh Spero, envisioning <a href="http://www.humaneventsonline.com/article.php?id=10444">a dystopian future America in which saying &#8220;Christmas&#8221; is outlawed</a>: <blockquote>&ldquo;Some of the people who stood up against the ACLU,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;were called Conservatives. In those days, you weren&rsquo;t welcomed in &lsquo;progressive&rsquo; circles if you were a Conservative. You didn&rsquo;t get those high-paying jobs in the media, Hollywood, or in the University. In fact, if they knew you were Conservative, you could even lose your job&#8212;and, if you wanted to keep your job, you had to undergo diversity training at Sensitivity Sessions and mouth the appropriate platitudes and apologies, even against your own conscience.&rdquo;</blockquote> <p>The Associated Press, describing <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/national/AP-Creationism-Class.html">the present America</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>A University of Kansas religion professor apologized for an e-mail that referred to religious conservatives as &#8220;fundies&#8221; and said a course describing intelligent design as mythology would be a &#8220;nice slap in their big fat face.&#8221;</p> <p>In a written apology Monday, Paul Mirecki, chairman of the university&#8217;s Religious Studies Department, said he would teach the planned class &#8220;as a serious academic subject and in an manner that respects all points of view.&#8221;</p> <p>The department faculty approved the course Monday but changed its title. The course, originally called &#8220;Special Topics in Religion: Intelligent Design, Creationisms and other Religious Mythologies,&#8221; will instead be called &#8220;Intelligent Design and Creationism.&#8221;</p> </blockquote> <p><a href="http://www.penguinputnam.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,0_1595230165,00.html">The backlash against religion-neutral holiday greetings</a> simply astounds me. Contrast: During the spring, I don&#8217;t see random strangers wishing me a happy Passover, or asking my child what present he&#8217;s hoping to get in exchange for the <i>afikoman</i>. Despite this inattention, <a href="http://www.ujc.org/content_display.html?ArticleID=83795">two-thirds of Jews attend Passover <i>sedarim</i></a>. But if you suggest that it&#8217;s not appropriate to say &#8220;Merry Christmas&#8221; to your heathen customers, the wingnuts whine about the Atheist Inquisition coming to town. Of course, if the wingnuts weren&#8217;t gnashing their teeth over this imagined insult to their faith, they might notice that God&#8217;s Own Party lost interest in some of their particular concerns (Federal Marriage Amendment? What&#8217;s that?) as soon as it was safely re-elected, or that some of God&#8217;s Own Politicians <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/007121.php">need to review Deuteronomy 16:19</a>.</p> <p>P.S.: No, Virginia, it really is not appropriate to say &#8220;Merry Christmas&#8221; to someone who will not be celebrating it, and I don&#8217;t care how many <a href="http://www.townhall.com/opinion/columns/jeffjacoby/2004/12/20/14002.html">other Jews</a> tell you it&#8217;s OK. It&#8217;s like being introduced to someone named &#8220;Michael&#8221; and calling him &#8220;Mike&#8221;, without bothering to find out if he actually uses that nickname. It&#8217;s like assuming that every pregnant woman you meet would just love to hear your advice about what she should be eating and drinking.</p> <p class="via">Spero column via <a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/i_see_stupid_people/">Pharyngula</a></p></p>
