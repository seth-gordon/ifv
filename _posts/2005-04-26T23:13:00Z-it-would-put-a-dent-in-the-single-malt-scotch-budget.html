<p><p><a href="http://alpha-geek.com/2005/04/20/overcoming_indecisiveness" target="_blank" class="blines3" title="Link outside of this blog">Alpha-Geek</a> came across the following decision-making technique, quoted from Herodotus:</p> <blockquote>If an important decision is to be made [the Persians] discuss the question when they are drunk and the following day the master of the house&#8230;submits their decision for reconsideration when they are sober. If they still approve it, it is adopted; if not, it is abandoned. Conversely, any decision they make when they are sober is reconsidered afterwards when they are drunk.</blockquote> I would propose this to my synagogue&#8217;s Board of Directors, but I embarrass myself enough at Board meetings when I&#8217;m sober.</p>
