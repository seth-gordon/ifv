<p><a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/enforcing-gpl.html">Eben Moglen</a>, FSF general counsel, on 10 September 2001: <blockquote>&#8220;Look,&#8221; I say, &#8220;at how many people all over the world are pressuring me to enforce the GPL in court, just to prove I can. I really need to make an example of someone. Would you like to volunteer?&#8221;</blockquote> <p><a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/09-29-2003/0002025751&EDATE=">The SCO Group</a>, on 29 September 2003, responding to <a href="http://www.sco.com/ibmlawsuit/ibmamendedcounterclaims.pdf">IBM&#8217;s latest counterclaims</a> in <i>SCO v. IBM</i>:</p> <blockquote>The GPL has never faced a full legal test, and SCO believes that it will not stand up in court. We are confident that SCO will win the legal battle that IBM has now started over the GPL.</blockquote></p>
