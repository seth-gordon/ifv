<p>Every once in a while, I hear someone remark, with sadness or frustration, that the GOP is more Good For The Jews&trade; than the Democratic Party, so why do Jews still overwhelmingly vote for Democrats?</p>
	<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I present Exhibit DCXXII: <a href="http://www.jta.org/cgi-bin/iowa/breaking/101208.html">Tommy Thompson</a>, Republican, former Governor of Wisconsin, former Secretary of Health and Human Services, currently running for President, speaking to the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>I&#8217;m in the private sector and for the first time in my life I&#8217;m earning money. You know that&#8217;s sort of part of the Jewish tradition.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>PS: <em>Tommy</em> Thompson, the former Governor of Wisconsin, should not be confused with <em>Fred</em> Thompson, the former Senator from Tennessee who plays the DA on <em>Law and Order</em>. </p>
