<p>If you&#8217;ve ever been over to chez Gordon for a Shabbat meal, you know that Psalm 126 (which is traditionally read before <i>Birkat ha-Mazon</i>) scans to &#8220;Scotland the Brave.&#8221; <p>But did you also know that &#8220;Maoz Tzur&#8221; scans to &#8220;Fortuna Imperix Mundi,&#8221; the opening song of <cite>Carmina Burana?</cite></p> <p>And did you know that much of Dr. Seuss&#8217;s <cite>One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish</cite> scans to &#8220;Tumbalalaika?&#8221;</p></p>
