<p>This is quite a week for teshuvah. On Wednesday, Richard Clarke, the National Security Council&#8217;s former counterterrorism coordinator, shocked the audience at <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A20349-2004Mar24.html">the 9/11 commission hearings</a> by, of all things, <em>apologizing</em>: <blockquote> <p>[Y]our government failed you, those entrusted with protecting you failed you and I failed you. We tried hard, but that doesn&#8217;t matter because we failed.</p> <p>And for that failure, I would ask&nbsp;&#8212; once all the facts are out&nbsp;&#8212; for your understanding and for your forgiveness.</p> </blockquote> <p>In today&#8217;s parsha, we read the laws (Leviticus 4&#8211;5) for the various kinds of offerings that people bring for expiation of various kinds of sin. Isaiah, in this week&#8217;s haftorah, continues on this theme: &#8220;I have erased your transgressions like a cloud, and your sins like a mist; return to Me, because I have redeemed you&#8221; (Isaiah 44:22).</p> <p>And finally, on Wednesday night, it will be the 10th day of Nissan&nbsp;&#8212; that is, exactly six months between the last Yom Kippur and the next.</p> <p>In the rules for sin-offerings, a pattern stands out. For almost every one of these offerings, the text explicitly says that the sacrifice is brought when the sinner <em>finds out about</em> the sin. Knowledge of <em>what you did wrong</em>, not merely a vague suspicion that you are falling short of the mark, is an essential part of the process for teshuvah.</p> <p>This rule contrasts with Job&#8217;s practice of bringing sacrifices on his sons&#8217; behalf, saying &#8220;perhaps they have sinned, and cursed God in their thoughts&#8221; (Job 1:5). There&#8217;s no indication there that his sons believed <em>themselves</em> to be sinning, or that Job did anything to encourage them to be more careful. He acts like a parent making the minimum monthly payment on a son&#8217;s credit card without ever looking at the bill. Repentance, however, is not a bill that we owe God; it&#8217;s a process of self-improvement that we owe to ourselves. Job&#8217;s attitude is not far removed from Paul of Tarsus, one of the founders of Christian doctrine, who claimed that it&#8217;s impossible to fulfill halakha, and therefore we <em>need</em> the alleged sacrifice of Jesus to substitute for even attempting to observe the law. Wrong, wrong, wrong.</p> <p>In modern times, we see a new way to evade the obligation to know our own sins: the political non-apology of &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry <em>if</em> I have offended anybody.&#8221; When a politician says this, it&#8217;s easy to translate: &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve done anything wrong, or at least I&#8217;m not going to admit any guilt in a way that would make my lawyer&#8217;s job harder, but I regret that certain hypersensitive people have made a big deal about my behavior.&#8221; But some Jews make a similar error when they approach their neighbors in the days leading to Yom Kippur and say, &#8220;Please forgive me for anything I may have done to you last year.&#8221; OK, if you want to <em>give</em> blanket forgiveness to everyone around you, good for you. But <em>asking</em> forgiveness in this way puts the person you ask in a difficult position. If you&#8217;ve done this in the past, you have six months to come up with a better strategy.</p></p>
