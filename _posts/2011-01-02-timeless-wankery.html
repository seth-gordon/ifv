<p>Sometimes, when technology marches on, it tramples popular culture under its jackboots. For example, I often wonder what people who grew up with e-mail and cellular phones make of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diva_(film)"><i>Diva</i></a>, a film in which half the cast chases the other half around looking for surreptitious tape recordings.</p>

	<p>But sometimes, an artist recognizes a fundamental truth of human nature that transcends the hardware of the age. Compare Flanders and Swann&#8217;s fifty-year-old <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fJmmDkvQyc">“Song of Reproduction”</a> with <a href="http://xkcd.com/841/">the latest xkcd strip</a>.</p>
