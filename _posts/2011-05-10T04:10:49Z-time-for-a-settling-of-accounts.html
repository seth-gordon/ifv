<p>On the way home from work, I saw an advertisement plastered across the back of a bus, announcing that <a href="http://www.ebiblefellowship.com/may21/">the Christian Day of Judgment will come on May 21st</a>. This led me to wonder:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>When someone sells ad space to anyone annoucing an impending apocalypse, should they demand payment in full up front?</li>
		<li>If the vendor normally sells space on more generous terms (e.g., net 90 days), can the apocalyptic purchaser sue for religious discrimination?</li>
	</ol>

	<p>The legal beagles among my readership may start preparing their memoranda, which are due in two weeks.</p>
