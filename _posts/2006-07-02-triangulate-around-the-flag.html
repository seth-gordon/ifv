<p>I have decided to stop caring about the flag-burning amendment. Carving out this one little exception to American free-speech jurisprudence would be a <em>stupid</em> thing to do, but its practical effect on our ability to express ourselves would be infinitesimal. If the amendment is ever ratified and I&#8217;m sufficiently pissed off at the government, I can always burn <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seal_of_the_United_States">the Great Seal of the United States</a> or some such.  And if some Democratic members of Congress need to curry favor with swing voters, I&#8217;d much rather see them do it by voting to restrict flag-burning rights than by voting to restrict abortion rights.</p>
	<p>However, the next time this issue comes round on the guitar, I would encourage every non-Southern Democrat to propose a different form of the amendment: <a href="http://www.law.ucla.edu/volokh/flag.htm">Congress shall have power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States, and the flying of the Confederate flag.</a> You want a wedge issue, Mr. Rove? I&#8217;ll give you a wedge issue&#8230;</p>
