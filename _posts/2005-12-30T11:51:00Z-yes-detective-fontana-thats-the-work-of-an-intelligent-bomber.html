<p>Some thoughts inspired by <a href="http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/msnbc/sections/news/051220_kitzmiller_342.pdf"><em>Kitzmiller v. Dover</em></a>:</p>  <p>Suppose you are walking through a field and you find a watch.  As every student of theology knows, once you see the watch, you know there must have been a watchmaker.  But that&#8217;s not <em>all</em> you know. You can look at the brand name and determine what company made the watch, and then you&#8217;ll know where you could go to get another watch like it, and you could even estimate how much it would cost.  If you&#8217;re a horologist, you might be able to figure out when the watch was made.  If you&#8217;re a customs inspector, you might be able to tell if the watch labeled &#8220;Rolex&#8221; is a real Rolex or a counterfeit.</p>  <p>In every field where people examine sapient-created artifacts, the examiners want to <em>learn about</em> the creators, not just confirm their existence.  Historians analyzed <em>The Federalist Papers</em> to determine which documents were written by which Founding Father.  An archaeologist who finds a stone blade will try to determine what it was used for and when it was made.  A homicide detective wants to identify the perpetrator.</p>  <p>One of the basic propositions of Intelligent Design Theory is that while &#8220;microevolution&#8221; takes place, &#8220;macroevolution&#8221; is a fiction created by those wily Darwinists.  Walter Brown of the Center for Scientific Creation distinguishes micro- and macroevolution by saying that the latter <a href="http://www.creationscience.com/LifeSciences2.html">&#8220;requires new abilities, increasing complexity, and new genetic information&#8221;</a>. If a baterial strain develops resistance to an antibiotic, does that count as a &#8220;new ability&#8221;?  Of course not, says <a href="http://www.creationresearch.org/crsq/articles/41/41_4/bact_resist.htm">a recent article in the <em>Creation Science Research Quarterly</em></a>, because a strain that gains resistance to an antibiotic usually loses some other quality, such as virulence.  But by that logic, <em>any</em> change in an organism&#8217;s traits can be dismissed as &#8220;microevolution&#8221;, since any change has both benefits and costs. (Humans have bigger brains than apes.  The benefit is that we can think of solutions to problems that apes can&#8217;t solve.  The cost is that in order to fit our skulls through our mothers&#8217; pelvises at birth, we are born premature by primate standards, and we depend on the care of adults for a longer period of time.)</p>  <p>Suppose, for the purpose of argument, that there is a meaningful distinction between micro- and macroevolution, and that the latter does not occur.  Given two organisms, how can we tell whether or not they have a common ancestor?  At what point would they become just dissimilar enough to be classified in separate trees?  <a href="http://www.creationresearch.org/crsq/articles/37/37_2/baraminology.htm">This <em><span class="caps">CSRQ</span></em> article</a> goes on at great length about &#8220;the ten-year-old field of baraminology&#8221; (the term is derived from the Hebrew &#x05d1;&#x05e8;&#x05d0; &#x05de;&#x05d9;&#x05df;, &#8220;He created a type&#8221;), defining the terms &#8220;holobaramin&#8221;, &#8220;monobaramin&#8221;, &#8220;apobaramin&#8221;, &#8220;polybaramin&#8221;, &#8220;archebaramin&#8221;, &#8220;neobaramin&#8221;, and &#8220;paleobaramin&#8221;, without answering this question.</p>  <p>Instead of performing this kind of actual research, creationists focus on packaging themselves for school boards.  First we had outright Biblical creationism taught in taxpayer-funded schools.  When the Supreme Court declared that unconstitutional, we had &#8220;creation science&#8221;.  When the courts remained unconvinced by the renaming, &#8220;Intelligent Design Theory&#8221; burst onto the scene, and to make sure the theory was not challenged as unscientific, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/EDUCATION/11/08/evolution.debate.ap/">the Kansas Board of Education redefined &#8220;science&#8221;</a>.</p>  <p>It&#8217;s as if a police department, frustrated by accusations that they were not solving enough murder cases, declared every case closed as soon as they classified it as a homicide, and didn&#8217;t bother to actually look for the murderer.  We wouldn&#8217;t put up with that kind of laziness from our police; we shouldn&#8217;t teach our children that the same attitude is acceptable from a scientist.</p>  <p class='via'> for the contrary view, see <i>Cross-Currents</i>: <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2005/12/21/bad-arguments-bad-decision/">1</a> <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2005/12/22/rabbi-avi-shafran-on-intelligent-design/">2</a> <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2005/12/25/the-courts-contempt/">3</a> <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2005/12/26/rabbi-shafran-responds/">4</a> <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2005/12/29/the-sisson-memo-reprise/">5</a> </p>
