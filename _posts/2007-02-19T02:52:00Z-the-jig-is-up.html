<p>Now that <a href="http://www.capitolannex.com/IMAGES2/CHISUMMEMO.pdf">members of the Texas and Georgia state legislatures</a> [PDF] have caught on, I suppose there&#8217;s no point in denying it any more.  Yes, indeed, modern cosmologists and evolutionary scientists are blindly and unscientifically following <a href="http://www.fixedearth.com/Evol.is%20Religious%20Doctrine.htm">kabbalistic teachings that the world is billions of years old</a>. Likewise, we crafty Pharisees are responsible for hiding anti-Biblical kabbalistic doctrines in the guise of <a href="http://www.fixedearth.com/knowledge%20impact.htm">Copernicus&#8217;s theory of heliocentrism and, later, Einstein&#8217;s theory of relativity</a>. It&#8217;s all true! They found us out!</p>
	<p>Also, that stuff about the banks? They got us dead to rights. Next time your mortgage payment comes due, just make the check out to me and send it over here; you&#8217;ll get faster service that way.</p>
