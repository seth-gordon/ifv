<p>Excerpt from <a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-beck/?open&ca=dgr-jw16j-beck">this interview</a> with Kent Beck, the Extreme Programming guru: <blockquote>I wish developers would consider the enormous consequences of their actions. When I got my driver&#8217;s license at 16, I was both elated and terrified; I had newfound freedom and responsibilities to go with it. Now, compare that feeling to when Microsoft sends me a new operating system. Do I have the same feeling? No, I think it&#8217;s going to screw up my life for months. For how many decades and for how many millions of people has that negative emotion been created around software. I think it&#8217;s such a shame we set our sights so low. Either you&#8217;re stuck with software that works the way it works because you don&#8217;t want to break it, or you get an upgrade that causes pain and anguish. I just want my stupid computer to work and it doesn&#8217;t. That&#8217;s not computing.</blockquote></p>
