<p>At Thursday night&#8217;s banquet for the Conservative Political Action Conference, Representative Michele Bachman (R-Minn.), the emcee, was so moved by Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele that she told him: <a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/02/27/steele-to-cpac-the-republican-party-is-just-fine/">“You be da man!”</a></p>

	<p>(Steele, of course, is <del>da</del> the man who was chosen for party chairmanship solely for his qualifications, and not at all because of <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0209/Steele_offers_Jindal_slum_love.html?showall">his African-American-ness</a>, because Republicans are all staunchly colorblind and would never demean a black man by making him think he might owe his job to affirmative action.)</p>

	<p>I&#8217;m glad to see that the Grand Old Party may give up on this whole politics thing and rebrand itself as a comedy troupe.  But someone really ought to give Rep.&nbsp;Bachman better lines.  <a href="http://ta-nehisicoates.theatlantic.com/archives/2009/02/distinguished_officials_for_proper_ebonics.php">The proper idiom</a> is &#8220;you da man&#8221;, not &#8220;you be da man&#8221;.  If you&#8217;re going to speak <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American_Vernacular_English">African American Vernacular English</a>, then for the love of God and Langston Hughes, speak it <em>properly</em>.</p>
