<p>If you can read this, your browser or feed aggregator was successfully redirected to the <a href="http://textpattern.com">TextPattern</a>-based version of this blog. Permalinks to the old blog will continue to work until I either set up a massive number of redirects or screw up my Apache configuration again.</p>
	<p>All the old entries should have been imported, although there are some formatting glitches, especially in the entries with source code. All the non-spammy comments should also be here.</p>
	<p>I have resisted the urge to spend six months tweaking the design before going live, but I will just point out that in this new layout, if you&#8217;re using a text-based browser, the content conveniently precedes the stuff in the sidebars; and if you&#8217;re not, the colored background of each entry has <em>four rounded corners</em>.  Ph33r my 31337 CSS $kill$.</p>
