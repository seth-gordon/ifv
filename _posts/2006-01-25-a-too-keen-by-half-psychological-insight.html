<p>Chullin 109b has these, er, comforting words:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Yalta said to Rav Nachman [her husband]: Because for everything that     the Merciful One forbade us, He permitted something equal:</p>      <ol>   <li><p>He forbade us blood&#8212;He permitted liver;</p></li>   <li><p>having sexual relations during menstruation&#8212;having sexual      relations when the blood does not cause ritual impurity;</p></li>   <li><p>forbidden fat from a domesticated animal&#8212;the fat from the      same place on a wild animal;</p></li>   <li><p>pork&#8212;<em>shibuta</em> brains;</p></li>   <li><p><em>giruta</em>&#8212;<em>lishna d&#8217;kavra</em> [two species of bird, according      to Rashi];</p></li>   <li><p>a married woman&#8212;a divorc&eacute;e while her ex-husband is      still alive;</p></li>   <li><p>a sister-in-law&#8212;a brother&#8217;s widow [cf. Deuteronomy 25:5&ndash;6];</p></li>   <li><p>a non-Jew&#8212;the beautiful woman captured in wartime      [cf. Deuteronomy 21:10&ndash;14].</p></li>   </ol> </blockquote>  <p>I&#8217;m trying not to think too much about #6, and failing.  Ugh!</p>
