<p>I know I&#8217;m just projecting the values of my own community of religious fanatics (and I mean that in the <em>nicest</em> possible way) onto a community of people who are fanatics about a completely different religion, but I can&#8217;t look at <a href="http://www.cynical-c.com/archives/2005_11.html#004232">pictures like this</a> without thinking &#8220;If you&#8217;re so religious, shouldn&#8217;t you be covering your elbows? Not to mention your midriff?&#8221; <p>(See also Matthew 6:6. Ahem.)</p></p>
