<p>The Ten Commandments begins: &#8220;I am the Eternal, your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, from the domain of slavery&#8221; (Exodus 20:2). Some medieval commentators were bothered by this introduction. Wouldn&#8217;t it be more appropriate for God to introduce Himself as the creator of the whole universe, instead? <p>No, it wouldn&#8217;t be.</p> <p>Suppose you bought new Ford car, and after a few years driving it, you discover the owner&#8217;s manual in the glove compartment. Flipping through the manual, you come across a warning message: &#8220;Do not drive this car to any Chevrolet dealership.&#8221; If you would feel morally bound by this restriction, because it was imposed on you by the creator of your vehicle, then you might be qualified for a job as a medieval theologian. If not &#8230; you see the problem. Yeah, God created the universe, and now He doesn&#8217;t want me to light a fire on Saturday. Why should I care what He wants? This is where the Exodus comes in.</p> <p>A few verses before the burning bush, &#8220;the Israelites were groaning from their slavery, and they cried out <i>(vayiz`aku)</i>; their pleas from their slavery went up before God&#8221; (2:23). The root <i>z-`-k</i> only appears in one other place in the Chumash, namely, God&#8217;s description of the situation in Sodom: &#8220;The outcry <i>(za`akat)</i> of Sodom and Gomorrah is very great&#8221; (Genesis 18:20). In both places, people are not merely crying out from pain; they are crying out <em>because they are being treated unjustly;</em> in response, God executes judgment on their oppressors.</p> <p>Through our cries, we acknowledged God&#8217;s role, not as Creator, but as Judge. Having done so, it would be hypocritical for us to say &#8220;OK, you were right to trash the Egyptians, thank you very much, but you shouldn&#8217;t punish <em>us</em> for not doing what you want.&#8221; The Israelites in the desert, even when they sinned, understood this principle. Except perhaps for the golden-calf incident, they never said, &#8220;We&#8217;re glad to be out of Egypt, but we&#8217;re going to defy God&#8217;s commandments anyway.&#8221; Whenever they rebelled against Moses, they talked about going back to Egypt&#8212;denying that salvation from Pharoah had given them any benefit.</p></p>
