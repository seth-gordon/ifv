<p>A few months ago, conservatives were lecturing <a href="http://www.thenation.com/doc.mhtml%3Fi=20031020&s=pollitt">us naughty left-wingers</a> for our poor manners. It seems that liberals, by criticizing our Commander-in-Chief, are debasing public discourse in America, undermining the high standards set by Newt Gingrich and Ann Coulter. <p>So I guess it&#8217;s our fault that the US Secretary of Education called the <abbr title="National Education Association">NEA</abbr> a <a href="http://www.muhajabah.com/islamicblog/archives/the_clipboard/008266.php">&#8220;terrorist organization&#8221;</a>. (The NEA is the largest teachers&#8217; union in the US, with 2.7 million members.) Perhaps we should send the NEA&#8217;s executive committee to Guant&aacute;namo. I&#8217;m sure the kids locked up there could use some teachers. They could start, of course, with some lessons in good manners.</p></p>
