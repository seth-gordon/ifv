Galambos even contributed a nickel into a trust fund for Thomas Paine&#8217;s heirs every time he used the word &#8220;liberty&#8221; in a lecture, because Galambos believed that Paine had <a href="http://www.tuspco.com/html/paine_coin-medal.html">invented</a> it.</p> <p>Apparently, the authors of <cite>Holy Blood, Holy Grail</cite> have become Galambosians: they believe that the concept of &#8220;Jesus survived his crucifixion, married, and had children&#8221; is their primary property, and they are demanding that the publishers of <cite>The DaVinci Code</cite> <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/index.cfm?c_id=1&ObjectID=9003822%22">cough up a few nickels</a>.</p> <p class="via">via <a href="http://thelookingglass.blogspot.com/2004/12/and-another-installment-of-new.html">Through the Looking Glass</a></p>
