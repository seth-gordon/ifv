<p>&#8230;although, perhaps, not in the right direction. <p>Shorter <a href="http://www.olimu.com/WebJournalism/Texts/Commentary/RealmOfChaos.htm">John Derbyshire</a>:</p> <p>&#8220;Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell thought that 9/11 was divine punishment for American hedonism. We Episcopalians don&#8217;t have such a crude view of divine justice. Then again, Episcopalian theology is kind of watered-down and PC compared to the way it was in the good old days, and those Baptists sound really butch when they breathe fire about God&#8217;s wrath being visited upon the heathens. Then again, they&#8217;re probably wrong.&#8221;</p> <p class="via">via <a href="http://www.matthewyglesias.com/archives/001330.html#001330">Matthew Yglesias</a></p></p>
