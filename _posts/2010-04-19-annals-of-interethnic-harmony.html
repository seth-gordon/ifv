<p>My younger brother once remarked to me that the most racially integrated institutions in Chicago were its street gangs. Over in the Holy Land, Jewish and Arab crooks used to do a brisk business with one another in stolen cars, although I don&#8217;t know if this is still going on.</p>

	<p>Along the same lines, I was pleased to learn from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/18/nyregion/18chinese.html?pagewanted=all">this <span class="caps">NYT</span> article</a> that when Frank Ma, &#8220;the last of the Asian Godfathers&#8221;, wanted to order a hit as a favor to a fellow Chinese gangster, he turned the job over to a team of four men, three Vietnamese and one Japanese.</p>
