<p>Heidi Bond <a href="http://blog.qiken.org/archives/000196.html">contemplates</a> the contract-law implications of this paragraph from <cite>Fellowship of the Ring</cite>: <blockquote>&#8220;As a small token of your friendship Sauron asks this,&#8221; he said: &#8220;that you should find this thief,&#8221; such was his word, &#8220;and get from him, willing or no, a little ring, the least of rings, that once he stole. It is but a trifle that Sauron fancies, and an earnest of your good will. Find it, and three rings that the Dwarf-sires possessed of old shall be returned to you, and the realm of Moria shall be yours for ever. Find only news of the thief, whether he still lives and where, and you shall have great reward and lasting friendship from the Lord. Refuse, and things will not seem so well. Do you refuse?&#8221;</blockquote> <p class="via">via <a href="http://amygdalagf.blogspot.com/2003_12_14_amygdalagf_archive.html#107196079907126869">Amygdala</a></p></p>
