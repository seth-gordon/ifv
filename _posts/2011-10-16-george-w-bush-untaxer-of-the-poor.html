<p>In response to the <a href="http://wearethe99percent.tumblr.com/">we are the 99%</a> movement, a number of right-wingers have focused attention on the fact that <a href="http://the53.tumblr.com/">only 53% of Americans pay Federal income taxes</a>. (This statistic ignores all the <em>other</em> kinds of taxes that lower-income folks pay, but set that aside for a moment.) Who is responsible for this mass legalized tax evasion? <a href="http://keithhennessey.com/2010/04/15/off-the-rolls/">Republicans.</a></p>
