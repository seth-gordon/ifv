<p><a href="http://dynamic.ropine.com/yesh/article/greetings-from-virginia">As previously noted</a>, I am transferring my DSL service from Speakeasy ($70/month) to Verizon ($15/month). What I didn&#8217;t expect, when I made that fateful call to cancel my Speakeasy service, is there are a few (three? five? O Lord, when will it end?) days of lag between Speakeasy cutting me off and Verizon even <em>starting</em> to hook me up to its own systems.</p>
	<p>After about two hours on the phone with Verizon&#8217;s tech-support department, its provisioning department, its sales department, and its those-&shy;that-&shy;tremble-&shy;as-&shy;if-&shy;they-&shy;were-&shy;mad department, we have finally heard from someone who sounds technically clueful, and she has convinced us that &#8220;it takes three to five days&#8221; is <em>not</em> phone-company shorthand for &#8220;three to five days after the order shows up in our in-box, some technician finds the time to come down to the central office and disconnect two cables&#8221;. So I can&#8217;t get <em>too</em> mad at Verizon for the delay.</p>
	<p>But in the meantime, our house is off the Net. My wife and I can&#8217;t surf the Web from home; we can&#8217;t email from home. More importantly, we can&#8217;t manage our online bill payment from home, we can&#8217;t work on selling our car through Craigslist from home, and I can&#8217;t log in to work from home. How did people ever <em>live</em> this way?</p>
