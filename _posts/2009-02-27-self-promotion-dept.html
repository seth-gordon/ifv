<p>A short story of mine, &#8220;Very Truly Yours&#8221;, has been published in the (semi-pro) webzine <a href="http://www.polutexni.com/">Polu Texni</a>.  Seven thousand words is apparently a bit long for the Web, so they broke it into four parts: <a href="http://www.polutexni.com/?p=320">I</a> <a href="http://www.polutexni.com/?p=325">II</a> <a href="http://www.polutexni.com/?p=331"><span class="caps">III</span></a> <a href="http://www.polutexni.com/?p=337">IV</a>.</p>

	<p>After reading the first half of the story, Michael A. Burstein, an actual award-winning professional SF writer, said <a href="http://mabfan.livejournal.com/418900.html">“the idea behind the story is fascinating&#8230; the voice of the first person protagonist is compelling, and&#8230; I am now eager for Part <span class="caps">III</span> and the resolution”</a>.  I hope he is not disappointed.</p>

	<p>Thanks to Dawn Albright for publishing me, thanks to Michael for the kind words, and thanks to all the folks at the old Critical Mass writers&#8217; workshop for showing me where previous drafts of the story went wrong.</p>
