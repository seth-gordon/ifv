<p>It&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ou.org/chagim/elul/introelul.htm">Elul</a> &#8212; a time to reflect on the past and prepare for the future, a time to concentrate (even more than usual) on turning away from sin, a time to renew and rebuild those things that have been neglected.</p>

	<p>Such as, say, posting to a blog that&#8217;s been on a long hiatus.</p>

	<p>So I hear we have a Presidential election coming up in a few months&#8230;.</p>
