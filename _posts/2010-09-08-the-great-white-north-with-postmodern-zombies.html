<p>They say in Multiculturally Sensitive Writers&#8217; School that it&#8217;s A Good Thing to go beyond generic raceless people who will default to <a href="http://whatever.scalzi.com/2009/03/13/mary-anne-mohanraj-gets-you-up-to-speed-part-ii/">generic white</a> in the average reader&#8217;s mind. Instead, wherever possible, give your characters ethnicities, nationalities, etc., and think about how their upbringing as African-American, or Irish, or Lithuanian-Jewish, or whatever, has molded them. If you make the effort to develop your characters along these dimensions, your stories will be the better for them.</p>

	<p>I was reminded of this principle tonight while watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1226681/">Pontypool</a>, Bruce McDonald&#8217;s B-movie about a winter zombie-like infestation of a small Ontario town. The movie isn&#8217;t merely set in Canada; it doesn&#8217;t just use Canadian winter as a backdrop to the isolation of its characters; <em>Canadian bilingualism is essential to the plot</em>.</p>

	<p>OK, the acting is less than Oscar-quality, but how much interpretive nuance do you really need in a horror movie?</p>

	<p>If your tax dollars helped subsidize this film, you can be proud.</p>
