<p><p>Suppose you&#8217;re a teacher, and you give your class a test, and they don&#8217;t do as well as you had hoped. Of course, you have to mark which answers are right and which answers are wrong. But <em>grading</em> is not <em>teaching</em>. If you take your craft seriously, you have to pay attention to your students, look beyond the raw count of right and wrong answers, and ask: &#8220;How do my students perceive the world? What part of their perception is leading them to answer the questions this way? What can I do to help them think differently?&#8221; It&#8217;s a lot easier to ask these questions if you <em>respect your students</em>, and treat them as people who can also be your teachers.</p> <p>George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, and all their apparatchiks have worked very, very hard to earn our disdain, and I don&#8217;t want to deprive them of this property. But if you pour out your resentment on <em>the people who voted for them, as a class,</em> you&#8217;re hurting yourself and your country.</p> <p>We know that <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/printable/?critics/040830crat_atlarge">the vast majority of voters do not use an internally consistent political ideology to decide who to vote for</a>. (That majority is large enough to include Democrats and Republicans, so don&#8217;t gloat.) That means, ladies and gentlemen, that 59,249,702 American adults did <em>not</em> walk into the voting booth and think &#8220;I&#8217;m going to vote for Bush because I want to run our deficit into the stratosphere; give tax cuts to the incredibly wealthy; send our soldiers to die, kill, and torture to prop up a puppet regime in a country whose previous ruler posed no threat to the United States; and seize on every available excuse to gut every part of the Bill of Rights except for the Second Amendment.&#8221; Yes, that&#8217;s what they&#8217;re getting, and some fraction of them probably <em>do</em> want what they&#8217;re getting, but not the whole 59&nbsp;million.</p> <p>Americans were given a multiple-choice test, and 51% of them checked off the wrong box. If we want future elections to go the other way, we need to treat those 59&nbsp;million Americans as our students and teachers, and figure out where we have fallen short of our mission to teach them.</p> <p>Let me <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/27/politics/campaign/27TEXT-OBAMA.html?pagewanted=print&position=">quote</a> from the man who recently became a Senator from Illinois:</p> <blockquote> <p>Now even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us, the spin masters, the negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes. Well, I say to them tonight, there is not a liberal America and a conservative America&#8212;there is the United States of America. There is not a Black America and a White America and Latino America and Asian America&#8212;there&#8217;s the United States of America.</p> <p>The pundits, the pundits like to slice-and-dice our country into Red States and Blue States; Red States for Republicans, Blue States for Democrats. But I&#8217;ve got news for them, too. We worship an awesome God in the Blue States, and we don&#8217;t like federal agents poking around in our libraries in the Red States. We coach Little League in the Blue States and yes, we&#8217;ve got some gay friends in the Red States. There are patriots who opposed the war in Iraq and there are patriots who supported the war in Iraq.</p> <p>We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America.</p> </blockquote></p>
