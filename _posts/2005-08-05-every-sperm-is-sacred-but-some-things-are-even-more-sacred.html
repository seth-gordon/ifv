<p>The archdiocese of Portland, responding to a child-support lawsuit by a woman who got pregnant by a seminarian, argued that the mother had engaged &#8220;in unprotected intercourse&#8230;when [she] should have known that could result in pregnancy.&#8221; William Levada, who was archbishop of Portland when the lawsuit was filed, is now prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (the branch of the Vatican formerly known as the Inquisition).</p> <p>The lawyer who wrote that response says he doesn&#8217;t think Father Levada ever read it. Levada himself was unavailable for comment, so we have no idea if he is prepared to disavow his lawyer&#8217;s argument, or if he&#8217;s preparing to add a footnote to that whole &#8220;thou shalt not use birth control&#8221; doctrine.</p> <p class="via">via <a href="http://bitchphd.blogspot.com/2005/08/christ-this-is-pathetic.html" target="_blank" class="blines3" title="Link outside of this blog">Bitch Ph.D.</a></p>
