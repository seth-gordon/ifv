<p>The author of the &#8220;Everyone Needs Therapy&#8221; blog <a href="http://everyoneneedstherapy.blogspot.com/2009/10/humananimal-rights.html">informs us</a> that October is Domestic Violence Awareness Month, and highlights a program, co-sponsored by the American Humane Association, to help abused women take their pets with them into shelters.</p>

	<p>And just a few days ago, in synagogues all over the world, we read <i>Bereshit</i>, which describes the first recorded instance of domestic violence. That story, according to the midrash, also involves a pet. Nachmanides (s.v. Genesis 4:13) cites Bereshit Rabbah 22:27 as explaining that the &#8220;sign&#8221; that God set for Cain&#8217;s protection was actually a dog; Cain would know that wherever the dog went, he could follow safely.</p>

	<p>OK, it&#8217;s not a perfect parallel: Cain was a perpetrator of violence, not a victim. But unlike many other perpetrators since Genesis, he repented and, as far as we know from the text, didn&#8217;t do it again&#8230;</p>
