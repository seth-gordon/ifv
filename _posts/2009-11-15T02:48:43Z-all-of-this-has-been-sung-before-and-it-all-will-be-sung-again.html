<p>After I first heard the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.amazon.com/Philadelphia-Chickens-Sandra-Boynton/dp/0761126368">Philadelphia Chickens</a> CD, I went around telling friends and acquaintances, &#8220;There&#8217;s this Sandra Boynton CD with a song called &#8216;Belly Button&#8217;, and it&#8217;s a <em>round</em>! Get it? Belly button? Round? Isn&#8217;t that great?&#8221;</p>

	<p>More recently, we got a They Might Be Giants CD, <a href="http://www.theymightbegiants.com/shop/here-comes-science-dvd-cd-set/">Here Comes Science</a>, which contains this delightful song about meteors, and is <em>also</em> a round:</p>

<div style="margin: 1em"><object style="height: 344px; width: 425px"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/phewoN5DLV4"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/phewoN5DLV4" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowScriptAccess="always" width="425" height="344"></object></div>

	<p>If I thought there was the slightest hope of seeing the <a href="http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2008/04dec_leonids2009.htm">Leonids</a> in this neck of the woods, I would suggest getting a whole bunch of people to sing this on a hilltop as we watch.</p>

	<p>I guess I just like rounds. Who else composes rounds, these days? Is it a moribund art, like plays where all the characters speak blank verse?</p>
