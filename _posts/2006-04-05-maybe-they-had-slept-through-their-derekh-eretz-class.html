One who reads and learns and serves Torah scholars, and his buying and selling is not honest, and he does not speak pleasantly to people: what will people say about him? &#8220;Woe to so-and-so who learned Torah! Woe to his father who taught him Torah! Woe to his rabbi who taught him Torah! So-and-so, who learned Torah&#8212;<a href="http://www.officer.com/article/article.jsp?siteSection=1&#38;id=29695">look at how destructive his deeds are</a>, and how ugly his ways are!&#8221; Regarding him, it is written (Ezekiel 36:20): &#8220;People said about them, &#8216;This is the nation of the Eternal, who left His land&#8217;&#8221;. &#8212;<a href="http://images.e-daf.com/DafImg.asp?ID=1095&#38;size=1">Yoma 86a</a></p>

	<p>Once upon a time, an alumnus of a world-famous yeshiva was convicted of embezzlement. A reporter asked the rosh yeshiva, &#8220;How do you feel about this failure of your educational system?&#8221;  The rosh yeshiva replied, &#8220;On the contrary, I consider him one of our system&#8217;s greatest successes. Sure, he ended up an embezzler, but if he <em>hadn&#8217;t</em> gone to our school, he would have become, God forbid, a murderer!&#8221;</p>
	<p>In that vein, I suppose it&#8217;s a good thing that the lads in Borough Park, unlike us poor benighted Modern Orthodox folks, have community leaders who are &#8220;<a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2006/04/05/the-cardinals-chovevei-torah-and-crossing-lines/#more-715">so suffused with Torah excellence that [their] world view is a refraction of Torah itself</a>&#8221;. Imagine how bad the violence would have been if those leaders <em>hadn&#8217;t</em> been so suffused.</p>
