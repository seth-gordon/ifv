<p>Conversation between a nurse and my wife on Saturday night, shortly after she arrived at the maternity ward: <p>&#8220;You&#8217;re ten centimeters dilated, and the baby is at minus one.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;OK. Screw natural childbirth. Can I have the epidural now?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too late for that. The fastest way for you to get rid of the pain is to have the baby. You can push any time you want now.&#8221;</p> <p>Half an hour later, she was in much less pain.</p> <h1>Vital statistics</h1> <dl> <dt>Date and time of birth</dt> <dd>2004-08-15T02:32Z <b>(corrected)</b></dd> <dt>Mass at birth</dt> <dd>2.056 &times; 10<sup>27</sup> proton masses</dd> <dt>Length at birth</dt> <dd>8.6 &times; 10<sup>5</sup> wavelengths of the sodium D-line</dd> <dt>Apgar scores</dt> <dd>8 at birth, 9 five minutes later</dd> <dt>Name</dt> <dd>TBA at bris</dd> <dt>Bris</dt> <dd>2004-08-22 (exact time and place TBA)</dd> <dt>Gideon&#8217;s present for the baby</dt> <dd>a crib toy that looks like a book</dd> <dt>The baby&#8217;s present for Gideon</dt> <dd>a large toy bulldozer</dd> <dt>Associate producer credit</dt> <dd>Jon Kamens, for taking care of Gideon while his parents and emerging brother spent the night in the hospital</dd> </dl></p>
