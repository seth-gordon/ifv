<p>As every good Orthodox Jew knows, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_Hypothesis">Documentary Hypothesis</a>, the idea that &#8220;R&#8221; wrote the Torah by editing and amending previous writings by &#8220;J&#8221;, &#8220;E&#8221;, &#8220;P&#8221;, and &#8220;D&#8221;, is contrary to Jewish doctrine.</p>
	<p>(You can find <a href="http://www.soncino.com/Hertz_Pentateuch.asp">commentaries by famous rabbis</a> that argue against the Documentary Hypothesis at great length. I never quite understood the point; since God is capable of writing in whatever combination of styles He wants, a proof that the Torah resembles an anthology does not disprove God&#8217;s authorship. But I digress.)</p>
	<p>Most good Orthodox Jews probably <em>don&#8217;t</em> know, however, that <a href="http://hirhurim.blogspot.com/2006/03/who-wrote-torah.html">another hypothesis</a>, stating that God wrote the Torah by editing and amending previous writings by Adam, Noah, Abraham, and some of Abraham&#8217;s descendants, has been proposed by an impeccably kosher source.</p>
	<p>P.S.: Best comment to that blog posting:</p>
<blockquote><blockquote>The patriarchs wrote scrolls?! In what language, might I ask?</blockquote>Yiddish, of course. Duh.</blockquote>
