<p>David Horowitz doesn&#8217;t have many good things to say about his old comrades in Students for a Democratic Society, but he should acknowledge that Todd Gitlin, who used to be the SDS president, is on to something. <p>Gitlin&#8217;s 1980 book, <a href="http://www.ucpress.edu/books/pages/1515001.html">The Whole World is Watching</a>, described how mass-media coverage both influenced and isolated the New Left in the 1960s. Reporters and photographers were drawn to the scruffiest and most revolutionary members of the antiwar movement; SDS members, perhaps confusing media coverage with social influence, became progressively more and more inflammatory. By the time a <em>liberal</em> movement against the Vietnam War arose, it was completely separate from the New Left organizations and thinkers who had been opposing the war for years&#8212;because the liberals didn&#8217;t want to be associated with people who threw shit at cops.</p> <p>The New Right of the 2000s, it appears, is now trapped in the same positive-feedback cycle. Case in point: Horowitz&#8217;s <a href="http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=8793">review</a> of Ann Coulter&#8217;s latest book, <cite>Treason</cite>.</p> <p>When Coulter, in the wake of 9/11, opined that the US should invade Muslim countries, kill their leaders, and convert them to Christianity, she was booted from the <cite>National Review</cite>, but Horowitz invited her to continue publishing on his own <cite>FrontPage Magazine</cite>. (In the review, Horowitz says he &#8220;regarded Coulter&#8217;s phillipic as a Swiftian commentary on liberal illusions of multi-cultural outreach to people who want to rip out our hearts&#8221;. Uh-huh.) This, and similar sentiments, have won Coulter plenty of TV appearances and book sales.</p> <p>But then Horowitz read <cite>Treason</cite>. He heard Coulter (on <cite>Hardball</cite>) argue that &#8220;the Democratic Party, as an entity, has become functionally treasonable &#8230; [JFK&#8217;s] heart was in the right place but he was surrounded by bad policymakers and he harm[ed] the country and its national security.&#8221; And he realized the Coulter, aside from being full of it, was Bad For The Cause:</p> <blockquote>[T]his charge&#8212;that no Democrat, apparently including Jack Kennedy, can root for America&#8212;is obviously absurd, and if conservatives do not recognize that it is absurd, nobody is going to listen to us.</blockquote> Kevin Drum <a href="http://www.calpundit.com/archives/001593.html">laments</a>: <blockquote>Actually, though, it&#8217;s too bad to see that even conservatives are attacking Coulter since it means she&#8217;ll probably have to tone down her next book. I was looking forward to the third volume in her series in which we learn that Democrats from FDR forward have all been secret child molesters. Now I&#8217;ll never get to read it.</blockquote> <p>Don&#8217;t worry, Kevin&#8212;if the pattern that Gitlin observed holds true, either Coulter will continue to publish more and more outlandish &#8220;Swiftian commentaries&#8221;, or others will compete to outdo her, until the neoconservative movement generates its own versions of the SLA and the Weather Underground.</p> <p>It&#8217;s gonna be one of those decades.</p></p>
