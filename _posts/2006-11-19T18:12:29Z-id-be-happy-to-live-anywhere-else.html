<p>Yesterday's <i>Globe</i> had <a href="http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2006/11/18/love_it_or_leave_it?mode=PF">an article</a> (link will probably rot tomorrow) about how Allston, Massachusetts has been honored by inclusion in <i>The Absolutely Worst Places To Live In America</i>. The book&#x2014;whose author, a Boston College alumnus, can speak of Allston from personal experience&#x2014;refers to my neighboring neighborhood as &#x201c;a melting pot of upper-middle-class white kids eager to experience a brief taste of rebellious semiurban squalor&#x201d; full of &#x201c;faux Irish pubs, garbage, vomiting in the shrubbery, drunken brawling, late night/early morning car alarms&#x201d;.</p>
<p>This reminded me of the first two years of my marriage, when we lived in a basement apartment at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=168+Allston+St,+Allston,+MA&ie=UTF8&z=15&ll=42.349347,-71.137977&spn=0.01367,0.043259&om=1&iwloc=addr">the corner of Allston and Kelton streets</a>. One morning we woke up to find a pool of vomit on the path leading to our door; judging from the residue along the outer wall and windowsills, it had come from someone living four stories up. Unfortunately, I was unable to rouse the perpetrator by pounding on his back door (at 10:00 a.m. on a Sunday morning), so I left a note of complaint with the landlord, complete with a diagram of the splatter marks. (To be fair, the landlord was letting us have the apartment at below market value, which, considering what market value was back then, was a sorely needed favor.)</p>
<p>I guess if you can make it there, you&#8217;ll make it anywhere.</p>
