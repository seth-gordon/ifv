<p><em>Ha`aretz</em>, covering <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/890519.html">the eviction of some Jewish families from an illegal settlement in Hebron</a>, quoted Gershon Bar-Kochba, one of the residents who tried to resist eviction. The name also appeared in <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE2D6103CF936A35757C0A96F948260">this <em>New York Times</em> article from 1989</a>: &#8220;Gershon Bar Kochba, a seminary student from Hebron, was suspected of leading a group who opened fire on Palestinians in Hebron&#8230;&#8221;  And <a href="http://www.hebron.com/english/article.php?id=301">this article on the Hebron Jewish community&#8217;s Web site</a> laments that Gershon Bar-Kochba had to post a 25,000-shekel<sup><a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/#fn105549494346ba79063c9a5">1</a></sup> bond in order to bail out a 14-year-old settler, while Arab suspects were routinely released on their own recognizance<sup><a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/#fn116650476746ba79063d174">2</a></sup>. </p>
	<p>OK, this guy appears to be something of a <em>macher</em> in Hebron.  What astounds me is that he carries the name of <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/revolt1.html">the leader of the last Jewish revolt against the Roman Empire</a>. That revolt was thoroughly crushed by the Romans, after which all the remaining Jews were exiled from Judea, the province was renamed &#8220;Syria Palestina&#8221;, many Jewish practices (such as Torah study and Shabbat) were prohibited, and many rabbis were martyred. What kind of yeshiva bocher treats a guy like this as a <em>role model</em>? Does he learn from some Bizzarro-Talmud in which it says that God destroyed our Temple and exiled us from our homeland because we were insufficiently ruthless to our enemies?</p>

	<p class="fn" id="fn116650476746ba79063d174"><sup>2</sup> The article presented this as one example of how the Israeli government was treating Jewish settlers in Hebron more harshly than the Arabs. I mentioned this to my wife, and she said, &#8220;Well, they should. God Himself does.&#8221; After all, she went on, the Moslems only have the seven Noachide commandments to observe, while we have 613&#8230;of course, we can&#8217;t observe all of them today&#8230;and one of the reason we can&#8217;t observe all of them today is the misguided zealotry of Jews like the original Bar-Kochba.</p>
