<p>Before the story of Tzelophchad&#8217;s daughters is even told, their names are listed, in Numbers 26:33. The list appears again, in 27:1, before they ask their question to Moses about their inheritance, and a third time, in 36:11, in conjunction with the law requiring them to marry within their tribe. The laws related to their situation would have been just as clear without listing their names; why bother repeating them? <p>Even today, if parents have a run of three or more children of the same sex, they can expect some muttering and speculation, and possibly even rude questions, about whether or not they are disappointed, or &#8220;trying for&#8221; a child of the other sex, or some such. In a society as patriarchal as the ancient Middle East, one can imagine how much more gossip would surround a father with a prestigious ancestry who had five daughters and no sons.</p> <p>Perhaps Tzelophchad and his wife were trying to quench that gossip when they named their youngest daughter Tirtzah&#8212;from the root <i>r-tz-h</i>, &#8220;to be pleased with, to accept.&#8221; (See, for example, Genesis 33:10, Exodus 28:38, Leviticus 26:41.) Tirtzah and her sisters could observe that if the youngest child of the family was given this name, then <i>kal va-chomer</i> the four elder daughters were valued for who they were, and their parents had no regrets that God had only sent them daughters. With that self-confidence, they were able to present their case to Moses.</p> <p>The lesson for contemporary parents is left as an exercise for the reader.</p></p>
