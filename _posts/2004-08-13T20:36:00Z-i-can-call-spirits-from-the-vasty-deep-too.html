<p>Conversation this afternoon with my wife: <p>&#8220;How are you doing?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m writing code!&#8221; <i>[as opposed to plumbing the mysteries of WebLogic configuration, which occupied the rest of my week]</i></p> <p>&#8220;Does it work?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;I have no idea.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Well, <em>I</em> can write code&#8230;&#8221;</p></p>
