<p>When I am dictator of the world, I will make it illegal to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/02/science/02nann.html?" target="_blank" class="blines3" title="Link outside of this blog">broadcast images of minors on television, even if their parents consent</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>Dr. Deborah A. Borchers, a pediatrician in private practice in Cincinnati and a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on early childhood adoption and dependent care [said, regarding <cite>Supernanny</cite> and <cite>Nanny 911</cite>:] &#8220;As the children get older, they&#8217;ll watch the videotape of the shows of them being portrayed as brats, and they&#8217;ll be embarrassed.&#8221;</p> </blockquote> <p>You shouldn&#8217;t have to belong to the American Academy of Pediatrics to figure that out. So why would anyone sign up for these shows? Perhaps it&#8217;s because many people believe that the only mental-health treatment they can realistically afford is the kind that you pay for by prostituting yourself to Hollywood: not just the nanny shows, but <cite>Oprah</cite>, <cite>Dr.&nbsp;Phil</cite>, etc.</p> <p>And they might be right.</p>
