<p>Hey, look, it&#8217;s my <a href="http://dynamic.ropine.com/yesh/article/hello-world">fourth blogiversary</a>!</p>
	<p>According to my clever parsing of my HTTP logs, roughly 200 people (well, roughly 200 distinct IP addresses that are unlikely to belong to bots) read this blog directly over the Web; LiveJournal reports that 40 users are subscribed to its syndication feed over there; a smattering of other people might be reading this through other syndication services.</p>
	<p>So who <em>are</em> y&#8217;all?  Pull up some virtual chairs, introduce yourselves, advertise your own blogs. See, I even made the comment box bigger, so you can get comfortable.</p>
