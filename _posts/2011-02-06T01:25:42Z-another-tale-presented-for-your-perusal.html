<p>“The Blessed Ones”, for which I sought beta-readers <a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/article/married-white-man-creative-seeks-sadist">here</a>, has been rejected by <i>F&amp;SF</i> and <i>Asimov’s</i>, and I’m trying to work up the courage to submit it to Tor.com (one of the few other SF publications that will consider work above 10,000 words in length). I’ve gotten some good feedback on “Knives” (see <a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/article/in-honor-of-national-short-story-writing-month">here</a>), so after I get some other stuff out of the way I will start revising it. And while waiting for feedback on “Knives”, I wrote something else that I call “House Arrest”, a little over 5,800 words, which begins thusly:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
      The girl lifted her hands straight up as far as they could go,
      exposing bony elbows.  If she and the soldier had been standing
      toe-to-toe, her fingertips would have reached his nose.  Her
      hair was blond, like the soldier’s, but plumbline-straight
      instead of curly; a headband shaped like a row of daisies held
      it back from her high forehead.  The soldier aimed his pistol at
      her pale green Wharton School T-shirt, sighting on the <i>r</i>
      in <i>Wharton</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Please don’t hurt me,” she said.  “There’s food here.  Take
      whatever you want.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where are your parents?”  He kept his arm and his gaze steady,
      but was conscious of the loft above and behind the girl; he
      wondered if he would soon glimpse moving shadows in his
      peripheral vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl cocked her head.  “My father’s dead.  My mom’s in Long
      Island, in a nursing home.”  She waited for him to respond, and
      then smiled at him, exposing her teeth.  “My name is Tacey.
      Short for Anastasia—” she pronounced it <i>Anna-tay-shuh</i>—
      “of Washington County, daughter of Irene, daughter of Nina of
      Brooklyn.  What’s your name?”
    </p>
    <p>
      The front room measured about four meters across and three deep;
      Tacey had emerged from the bathroom door at the far side.  The
      soldier cursed himself for not looking more carefully through
      the windows before breaking in; he had assumed that with tourist
      season long over and no vehicle parked outside, the cabin must
      be empty.  He asked Tacey, “How old are you, miss?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Forty-eight.”  She started to lower one hand and then raised it
      again.  “This terminal just turned five.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You’re a housewife?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am.”  She puffed out her chest.  “I got an <span class="caps">MBA</span> from Wharton
      Online and I have a husband and I have <em>two</em> daughters.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Go on,” he scoffed.  <i>Homo vestae</i> housewives, unable to
      even cross the street in the flesh, depended on neighbors for
      the kind of social contact they couldn’t get over the Net.  None
      of them would choose to plant herself in a cabin in the Maine
      forest, twenty miles from the nearest town.  The soldier asked,
      “Where are your older terminals?  Where’s the one who gave birth
      to your daughters?”  Sweat had gathered in the small of his
      back, soaking through his shirt, pinned there by his knapsack.
      His beard itched.  It was mid-September, but the hot, muggy air
      felt like August.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tacey looked the soldier up and down and let out a slow sigh.
      “Every other terminal was culled,” she said.  “It’s part of my
      sentence.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your sentence?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’m a convict.  This is my prison.  Well, technically, house
      arrest.”
    </p>

I even have software that purports to translate <span class="caps">HTML</span> to various e-book formats (although the <span class="caps">PDF</span> converter doesn’t work), so if you want to read it on one of those newfangled devices, I can try to accommodate you. adTHANKSvance.</p>
