<p>Both IBM, in its <a href="http://www.sco.com/ibmlawsuit/ibmamendedcounterclaims.pdf">counterclaims against SCO</a>, and Red Hat, in its <a href="http://lwn.net/images/ns/rh-complaint.pdf">suit for declaratory judgement against SCO</a>, assert that SCO knows that its statements about Linux&#8217;s IP infringements are nonsense, and they&#8217;re just trying to pump their stock by libeling their competition. (See IBM counterclaims, &para;&nbsp;65; Red Hat complaint, &para;&para;&nbsp;67&#8211;69.) It&#8217;s interesting that neither IBM nor Red Hat make an argument that Moglen made in his <a href="http://www.osdl.org/docs/osdl_eben_moglen_position_paper.pdf">OSDL position paper</a>: <p>Even if Linux <em>does</em> infringe on an SCO copyright, the only people who are liable for that infringement are people who <em>distribute copies of</em> Linux. Merely <em>using</em> a program whose code violates someone else&#8217;s copyright is not illegal. Therefore, SCO&#8217;s offer to <a href="http://www.sco.com/scosource/linuxlicensefaq.html">sell UNIX licenses to Linux end-users</a>, and its threats to sue Linux users who don&#8217;t buy the licenses (Red Hat complaint, &para;&para;&nbsp;42, 45, 59&#8211;61), cannot be justified as an attempt to cash in on SCO&#8217;s legitimate IP rights; it&#8217;s a shakedown operation, plain and simple.</p> <p>Do IBM&#8217;s lawyers know something that Moglen doesn&#8217;t? Or are lawyers in the computer industry so accustomed to <a href="http://ropine.com/sethg/msvs-eula.txt">draconian licensing agreements</a> that they didn&#8217;t notice this point?</p></p>
