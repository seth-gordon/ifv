<p>This <a href="http://smarthome.com/4095.html">wireless X10 wall switch</a> comes with a perforated sheet of labels, so you can mark what each switch is controlling. The labels on the sheet include all the possible locations you can imagine having a lamp: &#8220;kitchen,&#8221; &#8220;bathroom,&#8221; &#8220;study,&#8221; etc., etc., etc., &#8230; and &#8220;cove.&#8221; <p>I can&#8217;t shake the image of some overweight guy, his garishly colored shirt open to reveal copious gold chains and chest hair, reaching out for his X10 remote and saying &#8220;Hey, baby, let&#8217;s go to my <em>cove</em>.&#8221;</p> <p>But maybe you can.</p></p>
