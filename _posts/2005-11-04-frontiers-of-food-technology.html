<p>First there was the nicotine patch, then there was nicotine gum, and now&#8230;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thegreenhead.com/science/2005/07/nicoshot-nicotine-beer-designed-to.php">nicotine beer</a>. It&#8217;s being produced by a German company; the authors of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinheitsgebot" title="German beer purity law"><i>Reinheitsgebot</i></a> must be spinning in their graves. <p>If this product makes it easier for nicotine addicts to tolerate no-smoking-in-restaurants laws, I suppose it&#8217;s a Good Thing. But what&#8217;s next? Tobacco Flakes breakfast cereal?</p></p>
