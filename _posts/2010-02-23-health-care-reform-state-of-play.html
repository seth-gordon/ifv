<p>Every once in a while my wife asks me, &#8220;So what <em>is</em> in this health-care reform bill, anyway, and what good will it do us?&#8221; And I usually answer something like &#8220;a hummina hummina hummina&#8221;, because with all the negotiations and plans and bills and amendments and proposals that have been floated for the past nine months, it&#8217;s hard to keep track. Fortunately, Igor Volsky, of the Center for American Progress&#8217;s &#8220;Wonk Room&#8221; blog, has compiled <a href="http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2010/02/22/obama-health-plan/">a handy table</a> showing the salient differences between the bill passed by the House, the bill passed by the Senate, and the compromise that the White House has proposed today.</p>

	<p>The common points, briefly, are:
	<ul>
		<li>Everybody except the very lowest-income families, or people whose premiums would be more than a certain percentage of their income, must buy insurance.</li>
		<li>Most employers will be pressured to provide insurance to their employees, but the exemption for small employers and the exact form of pressure varies among the bills.</li>
		<li>Lower-income households would get subsidies to help them pay their premiums.</li>
		<li>The subsidies are financed by some combination of an excise tax on high-premium insurance plans and a tax hike for higher-income families.</li>
		<li>If you like your current coverage, you can keep it, and will receive additional consumer protections.</li>
		<li>The &#8220;donut hole&#8221; in Medicare Part D will be gradually reduced or eliminated.</li>
	</ul></p>
