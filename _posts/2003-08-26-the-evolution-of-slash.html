<p>Catherine Salmon and Donald Symon have written a book, <cite>Warrior Lovers</cite>, in which they try to use evolutionary psychology (or sociobiology, or whatever they&#8217;re calling it this year) to explain <a href="http://www.brunching.com/enterpriseslash.html">slash fiction</a>. This strikes me as a silly idea on its face, but <a href="http://www.crookedtimber.org/archives/000398.html">Henry Farrell</a> was brave enough to read the book, and reports that yes, it is a silly idea.</p>
