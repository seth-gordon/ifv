<p>According to the preliminary figures from the Department of Labor, there were fewer initial unemployment claims last week than there were the week before. Of course, the corrected new-claims number for the week before last is higher than the preliminary new-claims number for that week. And last week, we were told that the preliminary new-claims number for three weeks ago was too low, and it, too, was corrected upward. Got that? No? Maybe <a href="http://wampum.wabanaki.net/archives/000571.html">Wampum</a> can explain it better than I can. Or you can go back to <a href="http://billmon.org/archives/000738.html">Billmon&#8217;s</a> observations regarding a similar correction of a different employment statistic, three weeks ago.</p>
