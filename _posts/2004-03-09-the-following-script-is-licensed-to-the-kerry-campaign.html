<p><i>[Fade in. A TV, playing a tape of the Carter-Reagan 1980 debate, fills most of the screen.]</i> <p>REAGAN <i>[on tape]</i>: It might be well if you ask yourself: are you better off than you were four years ago? Is it easier for you to go and buy things in the stores than it was four years ago? Is there more or less unemployment in the country than there was four years ago? Is America as respected throughout the world as it was? Do you feel that our security is as safe? That we&#8217;re as strong as we were four years ago? And if you answer all of those questions yes, why then I think your choice is very obvious as to who you&#8217;ll vote for. If you don&#8217;t agree, if you don&#8217;t think that this course that we&#8217;ve been on for the last four years is what you would like to see us follow for the next four, then I could suggest another choice that you have.</p> <p><i>[Pan to KERRY, who is watching the TV. He turns to the camera.]</i></p> <p>KERRY: I&#8217;m John Kerry, and I authorized this message.</p> <p><i>[Fade out.]</i></p></p>
