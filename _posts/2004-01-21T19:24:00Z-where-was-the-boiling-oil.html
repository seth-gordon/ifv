<p>OK, now that my wife and I are the last geeks on this planet to have seen <cite>Return of the King</cite>, I have a question for the SCAdians and Tolkien fans in the audience. <p>Both <cite>The Two Towers</cite> and <cite>ROTK</cite> portray sieges of walled cities (Helm&#8217;s Deep and Minas Tirith, respectively) where towers are used to get the orcs over the walls. Why didn&#8217;t the defenders of either city pour boiling oil on the attackers as soon as they reached the walls?</p> <ol> <li>Oil is much more expensive in Middle-Earth than it was in medieval Europe</li> <li>Everybody knows that orcs are fireproof</li> <li>Those articles on siege warfare that I read in <cite>Dragon</cite> back in middle school cannot be trusted</li> </ol></p>
