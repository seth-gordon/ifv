<p>In Japan, I am told, if someone asks you to do something, it is considered very rude to embarrass them by saying &#8220;no&#8221;.  Instead, you say &#8220;that would be very hard&#8221;, or &#8220;let me think about that&#8221;, or some other euphemism for &#8220;I will accede to your request when hell freezes over&#8221;.<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/#fn13743480604bd0cc2b164af">1</a></sup></p>

	<p>In the Republican Party, when the Democrats propose a bill, it is considered very rude to embarrass your party by saying &#8220;actually I think the country was doing just fine the way it was before Obama was elected, so I will vote against any bill you care to present on this issue&#8221;. Instead&#8230;</p>

Finnish-Japanese business negotiations must be a real adventure.</p>
