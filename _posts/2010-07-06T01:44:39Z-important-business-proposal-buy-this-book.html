<p>Every once in a while my kids get a book about Africa from the library, and invariably, it reinforces the image of the continent as one massive wildlife preserve with the occasional village. You&#8217;d never know from these books that, for example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos">Lagos</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinshasa">Kinshasa</a> are among the largest cities in the world.</p>

	<p>Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani, born and raised in Nigeria, the daughter of an accountant and a teacher, apparently had a similar problem. In <a href="http://www.african-writing.com/seven/adaobinwaubani.htm">this interview</a>, she says:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Most of [the books I read as a child] were about African children living in mud huts and hawking oranges to pay their school fees.  I read so many of these books that I began wishing my family  also lived in a mud hut with thatched roof, and subsisted on proceeds from our yam farm.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>She went on to write <i><a href="http://www.hyperionmedianet.com/web/showpage/bookpage.aspx?program_id=3121089&type=lead">I Do Not Come To You By Chance</a></i>, a novel about urban, internationally connected, 21st-century Nigeria. My children are about ten years too young to appreciate it, but you, Gentle Reader, are not.</p>

	<p>The novel describes the coming-of-age of Kingsley Ibe, whose college-educated parents raised him to believe that hard work and a good education are his tickets to success and respectability. Except&#8230; in spite of his college degree and his excellent grades, Kingsley remains unemployed. As his family&#8217;s financial situation grows more desperate, his only source of help is his uncle, a high-school dropout who has become fantastically wealthy running <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_fraud">419 scams</a>. Hijinks, as they say, ensue.</p>

	<p>The novel hits almost all the right notes: the characters are engaging, the plot moves right along, and it is intriguing to see the whole world of Internet scams from the other side. The only place I lost suspension of disbelief is in a brief scene where Kingsley meets an old classmate who works in the United States, and rattles off the degrees that he and his American relatives have picked up. (A master&#8217;s in &#8220;Data Transmogrification&#8221; from Yale?)</p>

	<p>I don&#8217;t know if this is the author&#8217;s intention, but I can&#8217;t help reading the novel as a commentary on itself. Given the asides that explain Ibo culture and Nigerian politics, Nwaubani appears to have written the book deliberately for a foreign audience. Unlike the 419 scammers, she gives us honest value for our money. But like them, she can prosper by presenting a certain image of her country to people much wealthier than her compatriots. So when her depiction of Nigeria rings true, is it because her depiction <em>is</em> true? Or is it because she tells me what I want to believe? I&#8217;m betting on &#8220;is true&#8221;, because judging from the interview I linked to above, people in a position to know what Nigeria is really like don&#8217;t see anything amiss in the novel. And if Nwaubani <em>had</em> wanted to use her literary talents to make a dishonest buck, she could have been a kick-ass 419 scammer.</p>
