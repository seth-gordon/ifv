<p>I must congratulate my alma mater on reaching 12th place in <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/college_guide/rankings/national_university_rank.php">the Washington Monthly&#8217;s national university rankings</a>. (This is the ranking system that asks not what colleges do for their alumni&#8217;s reputations, but what all these well-endowed tax-exempt institutions are doing for their country.) Surely it is a mere statistical fluke, perhaps a slip of an editor&#8217;s pen, that led another well-known Cambridge educational institution to reach 11th place.</p>

	<p>Next year, try to beat Texas A&amp;M, OK?</p>
