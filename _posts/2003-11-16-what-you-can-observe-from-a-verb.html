<p>(Yeah, if I had read the parsha earlier in the week, I would have had time to post a drash before Shabbat, and it would probably be a better one, too. <i>`Al chet, `al chet.</i> I&#8217;ll try to do better this week. <i>Bli neder.</i>) <p>While reading the parsha, I noticed something in Genesis 18:17 &#8212; God wonders to himself whether or not he should hide &#8220;what I do&#8221; <i>(asher ani `oseh)</i>. If God had only been thinking about how much to tell Abraham about His plans for Sodom, He would have used the imperfect tense and said &#8220;what I will be doing&#8221; <i>(asher ani ya`aseh)</i>. So He&#8217;s actually referring to something much broader here.</p> <p>I mentioned this to my wife, who was preparing to give a drash at our synagogue for seudah shlishit, and it fit very well with the drash that she had prepared, so she included it. And she did a much better job than I did at studying the parsha and thinking about it, so you should <a href="http://dynamic.ropine.com/lucretia/vayera.writeback">read what she has to say</a> on her own blog.</p></p>
