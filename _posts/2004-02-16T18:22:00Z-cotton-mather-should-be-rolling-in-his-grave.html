<p>Here is the exact wording of <a href="http://www.pollingreport.com/religion.htm">an ABC News PrimeTime Poll</a>, taken last week: <blockquote>I&#8217;m going to ask about a few stories in the Bible&#8230;. The story about Moses parting the Red Sea so the Jews could escape from Egypt. Do you think that&#8217;s literally true, meaning it happened that way word-for-word; or do you think it&#8217;s meant as a lesson, but not to be taken literally?</blockquote> <p>Unfortunately, the poll results do not tell us how many people responded, &#8220;The Bible doesn&#8217;t say that Moses parted the Red Sea, you ignoramus.&#8221; Exodus 14:21 is quite clear:</p> <blockquote>Moses extended his hand over the sea, and the Eternal moved the sea with a strong east wind all that night, and He changed the sea to dry land; the waters were divided.</blockquote> <p>Oh, and <i>Yam Suf</i>, the Hebrew name that the Bible uses for the sea that the Jews crossed through, literally means &#8220;Sea of Reeds&#8221;. Whether or not you believe Exodus was written by God, it&#8217;s far from clear that the author was referring to the Red Sea.</p> <p><a href="http://www.markarkleiman.com/archives/_/2004/02/the_democrats_god_problem.php">Mark A.&nbsp;R. Kleiman calls this poll &#8220;profoundly depressing&#8221;</a> because 64&nbsp;percent of respondents (with a three-point margin of error) believe that story to be &#8220;literally true.&#8221; Personally, I&#8217;m profoundly depressed about how many people seem to revere the Bible without, y&#8217;know, <em>reading</em> it.</p></p>
