Don&#8217;t you think that&#8217;s disgusting and wrong? I don&#8217;t feel I can trust anybody now.</p>

	<p>Suppose you are responsible for information security at a cellphone manufacturer, and you are trying to prevent information about unreleased models from leaking into the press: not just <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5520164/this-is-apples-next-iphone">prototypes</a>, but pictures, specifications, roadmaps for future product development&#8230; all sorts of things that your employer wants to keep private.</p>

	<p>Let us consider your odds.</p>

	<p>Suppose that <i>N</i> people have access to information (from plans to physical prototypes to draft marketing materials) about every new model, and each of these people will, with probability <i>p</i>, leak some of the information about this model that they receive.  We can calculate <i>p*</i>, the probability that at least one person will leak at least one privileged details, as</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p><i>p* = 1 &#8211; (1-p)<sup>N</sup></i></p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Since <i>N</i> is (we hope) orders of magnitude higher than <i>p</i>, it may be numerically convenient to recast it as follows:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p><i>p* = 1 &#8211; </i>exp (<i>N</i> ln <i>(1-p)</i>)</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>If each employee of a cellphone manufacturer has a one-in-ten-thousand chance of leaking confidential information about each model, and information about a new model passes through a thousand hands, then the odds of a leak are about 9.5%. At two thousand employees, the probability goes up to 18%. At five thousand, it is 39%. At ten thousand, it is 63%.</p>

	<p>If a rigorous program of security education cuts <i>p</i> in half&#8212;i.e., five in a hundred thousand&#8212;then the chance of a leak among ten thousand confidantes goes back down to 39%. If <i>p</i> goes down to one in a hundred thousand, <i>p*</i> is down to 9.5%.</p>

	<p>(Yes, I was told what the actual values of <i>N</i> and <i>p*</i> are for my employer. No, I’m not telling you.)</p>

	<p>Which corporate initiative is more feasible: convincing every employee to be half as likely to leak sensitive information, or sharing that information among half as many employees in the first place?</p>

	<p class="mtb">Now let&#8217;s consider <a href="http://213.251.145.96/cablegate.html">Cablegate</a>, a series of leaks more newsworthy than next year’s smartphone specs. All the diplomatic cables released by Wikileaks were classified at the level <span class="caps">SECRET</span>/NOFORN or below, and had been distributed over <span class="caps">SIPRN</span>et, whose <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-11863618">explicit purpose</a> is to make it easy for cleared government employees&#8212;an estimated 2.5 million of them&#8212;to share classified documents with one another.</p>

	<p>Given the large number of people with <span class="caps">SIPRN</span>et access, if the Russian or Chinese intelligence services wanted copies of lightly-classified documents regarding matters that they cared about, how hard would it be for them to find a mole, even without Wikileaks? What does it <em>mean</em> for the US to assert that a document would cause &#8220;serious damage&#8221; to national security if revealed, making it a felony to share that document with the general public (including, ahem, <em>us voters</em>), and then give <em>millions</em> of government employees and contractors permission to read it?</p>
