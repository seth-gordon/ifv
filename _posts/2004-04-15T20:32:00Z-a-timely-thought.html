<p>According to the <a href="http://www.charitywatch.org/criteria.html">American Institute of Philanthropy</a>, &#8220;$35 or less to raise $100 is reasonable for most charities.&#8221; <p>By comparison, the Federal government, in its fiscal &#8216;04 budget, plans to spend about $40 billion on &#8220;administration of justice&#8221; and about $10 billion on tax collection, in a total budget of about $3250 billion. So even if we attribute the expense of <em>the entire Justice Department and Federal prison system</em> to the cost of government &#8220;fund-raising&#8221;, it costs the government less than $2 to raise $100. (These figures are from the <a href="http://www.budgetsim.org/nbs/longbudget04.html">National Budget Simulation</a>.)</p> <p>The next time someone tells you that private charities are &#8220;more efficient&#8221; than the government at achieving some worthy goal, remember these figures.</p></p>
