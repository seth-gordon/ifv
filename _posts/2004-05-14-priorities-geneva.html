<p>Excerpt from <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/world/articles/2004/05/14/prison_rules_not_humane/">an article</a> in today&#8217;s <cite>Boston Globe</cite>: <blockquote> <p>Interrogation rules issued last year in Iraq are &#8220;not humane,&#8221; a ranking defense official conceded yesterday, and a top general told senators that they may violate the Geneva Conventions on proper handling of military detainees.</p> <p>&#8230;</p> <p>[A memorandum by the senior American commander in Iraq] listed a variety of methods soldiers could use in interrogations, including &#8220;dietary manipulation,&#8221; or depriving inmates of food for certain periods so long as they were monitored by a medical officer; changing their environment, such as from hot to cold; keeping inmates awake for as long as three days at a time; isolating them for up to 30 days; using military dogs to intimidate prisoners; or forcing them to assume &#8220;stressful positions&#8221; for as long as 45 minutes.</p> </blockquote> <b><sarcasm></b> But you bleeding-heart liberals have to understand&#8212;Saddam had <em>weapons of mass destruction</em>, and when we caught his henchmen, they <a href="http://www.felbers.net/mt/archives/001567.html">wouldn&#8217;t tell us where they were</a>! Obviously, in order to get this information that&#8217;s so critical to America&#8217;s national security, torturing an inmate is morally justified&#8230; <b></sarcasm></b></p>
