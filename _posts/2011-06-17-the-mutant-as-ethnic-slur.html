<p>Reading various essays on the racial politics of the new X-men movie&#8212;see, for example, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/09/opinion/09coates.html">Ta-Nehisi Coates</a>, <a href="http://nkjemisin.com/2011/06/go-hollywood/">N. K. Jemisin</a> and <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/yglesias/2011/06/07/239187/magneto-was-right/">Matthew Yglesias</a>—reminds me just how sophomoric the whole &#8220;let&#8217;s use mutants as a metaphor for the oppressed minorities of the real world&#8221; conceit is. I mean, if African-Americans could fly or shoot laser beams out of their eyes or read white minds, the whole civil-rights movement would have turned out a bit differently, eh?<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/#fn10928223954dfb6bd7dc2d3">1</a></sup></p>

	<p>And when I squint at the idea long enough, it reminds me of how people who have not grappled with their own prejudice can relish their &#8220;positive&#8221; stereotypes about marginalized groups.  Jews are smart; Asians are stoically hard-working; African-Americans have natural rhythm; Roma have magical powers; gay men have excellent taste; etc.<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/#fn21056289004dfb6bd7dcaa7">2</a></sup> I guess I’d rather have undeserved praise than undeserved condemnation, but compliments based on a stereotype are not really compliments, and the Jews who are “smart” one year can be “crafty” the next.</p>

	<p>A well-chosen metaphor can illuminate the truth in a way that literal statements cannot, but this one does more to obscure than illuminate. Better super-metaphors, please.</p>
