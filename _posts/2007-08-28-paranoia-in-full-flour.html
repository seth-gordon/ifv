<p>The Boston Police Department, which took such heroic efforts to save our city from illuminated cartoon characters, <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20441775/">has some competition</a>:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p><span class="caps">NEW</span> <span class="caps">HAVEN</span>, Conn. &#8211; Two people who sprinkled flour in a parking lot to mark a trail for their offbeat running club inadvertently caused a bioterrorism scare and now face a felony charge.</p><p>The sprinkled powder forced hundreds to evacuate an <span class="caps">IKEA</span> furniture store Thursday&#8230;.</p><p>Mayoral spokeswoman Jessica Mayorga said the city plans to seek restitution from the Salchows, who are due in court Sept. 14.</p><p>“You see powder connected by arrows and chalk, you never know,&#8221; she said. “It could be a terrorist, it could be something more serious. We’re thankful it wasn’t, but there were a lot of resources that went into figuring that out.&#8221;</p>
