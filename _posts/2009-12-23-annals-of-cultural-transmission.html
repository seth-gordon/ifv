<p><i>Scene: The dinner table.</i></p>

	<p><strong>Father:</strong> What did you do in school today?</p>

	<p><strong>Five-year-old:</strong> It was too cold to go out for recess, so we saw a movie.</p>

	<p><strong>Father:</strong> What was it about?</p>

	<p><strong>Five-year-old:</strong> It was about a <em>snowman</em> who <em>came to life.</em></p>

	<p><strong>Father:</strong> So you saw <i>Frosty the Snowman</i>?</p>

	<p><strong>Seven-year-old:</strong> How did it work? And how did he die?</p>
