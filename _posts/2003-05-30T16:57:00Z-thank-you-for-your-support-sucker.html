<p>Australia was one of the few countries to join the &#8220;coalition of the willing&#8221; against Iraq. What is the US giving them for their efforts? <a href="http://www.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,4057,6505693%255E1702,00.html">A multi-million-dollar bill</a> for the American bombs that Australian pilots dropped and the American satellite bandwidth that Australian troops used. <p>The article describing this refers to &#8220;the &#8216;user-pays&#8217; principle of modern warfare&#8221;, a principle which I was not previously aware of.</p> <p>I suppose this is one way to bring down the deficit&#8230;.</p> <p>(via <a href="http://www.roadtosurfdom.com/surfdomarchives/001143.php">The Road to Surfdom</a>)</p></p>
