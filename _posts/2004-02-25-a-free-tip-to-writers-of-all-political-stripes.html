<p>If you find yourself writing <a href="http://www.adbusters.org/magazine/52/articles/jewish.html">an article about certain Jews</a>, and pat yourself on the back by writing &#8220;Anyone who does [what I&#8217;m doing] can count on automatically being smeared as an anti-Semite,&#8221; you&#8217;re an anti-Semite. (Likewise for other kinds of bigotry, of course.) As the Talmud says, if one person calls you a jackass, ignore it, but if two people call you a jackass, consider getting a saddle. If you&#8217;re going to be an anti-Semite, can you at least have the balls to be <em>proud</em> of it? <p class="via">via <a href="http://www.amptoons.com/blog/001296.html">Alas, a blog</a></p></p>
