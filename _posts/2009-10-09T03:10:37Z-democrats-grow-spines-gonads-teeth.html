<p>Many progressives, myself included, have been concerned that (a)&nbsp;Democratic politicians are so used to losing that they will continue to act like losers on the floor of Congress, even when they are in the majority; (b)&nbsp;with war, the economy, and health care at the front of most people&#8217;s minds, Obama and the Congressional Democrats will push <span class="caps">LGBT</span> issues to the back burner until, umm, half-past never.</p>

	<p>So let me give credit where credit is due: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/09/us/politics/09hate.html?hp">the House passed a bill to extend Federal hate-crimes protection to gay, lesbian, bi, <em>and trans</em> people</a>, and the Democrats played hardball to get it passed&#8212;they attached the hate-crimes extension to a defense-appropriations bill and dared the Republicans to vote against the whole bill.</p>

	<p>The article quotes Senator McCain, of all people, saying that &#8220;elections have consequences&#8221;. Elections damn well <em>should</em> have consequences and this particular consequence is most welcome.</p>
