<p>I guess I have to say something about McCain&#8217;s speech now, too.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>In the biopic preceding the speech, the narrator told the story of a massive and deadly fire aboard the <i><span class="caps">USS</span> Forrestal</i> caused by an accidental missile launch. Somehow, the narrator declared, McCain survived.  Perhaps, the narrator declared, <em>it was because he had more work to be done</em>. And the <em>Republicans</em> accuse <em>Democrats</em> of setting Obama up as a Messiah-figure? I am rubber and you are glue&#8230;</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>Did you know that McCain used to be a <span class="caps">POW</span>? And that he was in hell? And in a box for five years? And that he was dumped in a cell? And that he was a prisoner in another country? I&#8217;m impressed by how the biopic author and the speechwriter were able to <a href="http://www.peltorro.com/thesaurus.htm">rephrase the same concept</a> in so many different ways to fill up so many minutes. We saw and heard in vivid detail about McCain&#8217;s capture, his imprisonment, his endurance, and how it made him grow as a person.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>Not so much detail, though, on what he&#8217;s going to do if he&#8217;s elected. There was the standard Republican wish list: lower taxes, lower spending, school &#8220;choice&#8221;, and &#8220;culture of life&#8221;. There was a list of things that probably appeal to many voters but seem incompatible with lower spending: job training for people whose jobs have gone overseas, more pay for good teachers, and every alternative-energy source that Obama supports.  (Plus, of course, &#8220;drill now&#8221;.  I think &#8220;drill now&#8221; got as much applause as &#8220;culture of life&#8221;. Remember, ladies, if you abort that fetus, you deprive your country of a future offshore-drilling-rig technician.)</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>Before delivering that standard Republican wish list, McCain insisted that he&#8217;s <em>different</em> from all those Republicans who have been corrupted by &#8220;Washington&#8221;. He&#8217;s a &#8220;maverick&#8221;.  But he provided even less detail about what, exactly, he has done to distinguish himself from those <em>bad</em> Republicans. For example, he took credit for fighting &#8220;big spenders in both parties&#8221; without identifying any big expense that he fought against. Given McCain&#8217;s recent return to Republican orthodoxy, his boast deserves to be compared against his recent record.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>Oh, and McCain demonstrated his bipartisanality by saying &#8220;Instead of rejecting good ideas because we didn&#8217;t think of them first, let&#8217;s use the best ideas from both sides.&#8221; Did he name a good idea that came from the Democratic side? (Say, &#8220;nominate a woman for the vice-presidential position&#8221;?) Of course not.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>&#8220;I fight for Bill and Sue Nebe from Farmington Hills, Michigan, who lost their real estate investments in the bad housing market.&#8221;  See, Democrats fight for people who lost their <em>homes</em>. Republicans fight for people who lost their <em>real estate investments</em>.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>The paragraphs about Iraq, the surge, and Georgia seem to be repeats of earlier press releases and I can&#8217;t think of anything to say about them other than &#8220;yadda yadda yadda&#8221;.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>George W. Bush was not mentioned by name, only by title.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>McCain&#8217;s tone was folksy and mellow. I fear that in the swing states, that tone will get more attention than the content.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>This week&#8217;s sleep deficit has been brought to you by the Republican National Convention.  Maybe next time I should liveblog, just like the pros.</p>
