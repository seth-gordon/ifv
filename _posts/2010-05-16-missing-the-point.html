<p><i>Scene:</i> A father is reading <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ls49GMfqtzMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=and+tango+makes+three&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0zPwS9C4IIKC8gaI8d39Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">And Tango Makes Three</a> to his three-year-old son.</p>

	<p><i>Father:</i> &#8220;&#8230;Roy and Silo taught Tango how to sing for them when she was hungry. They fed her food from their beaks. They snuggled her in their nest at night. Tango was the very first penguin in the zoo to have two daddies.&#8221;</p>

	<p><i>Three-year-old son:</i> No. One of them has to be the mommy.</p>
