<p>OK, I&#8217;ve been defending Israel&#8217;s actions in Lebanon because, in the absence of other information, I want to give them the benefit of the doubt that they are trying in good faith to fight a clean war, to the extent that such a thing is possible.</p>
	<p>That&#8217;s a little harder to do when seeing news like <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1153291987290&#38;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull">this</a></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>A high-ranking [Israel Air Force] officer caused a storm on Monday in an off-record briefing during which he told reporters that IDF Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Dan Halutz had ordered the military to destroy 10 buildings in Beirut in retaliation to every Katyusha rocket strike on Haifa.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>At least the IDF had the decency to be embarrassed by a threat to violate article 33 of the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/92.htm">Fourth Geneva Convention</a>:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>The IDF Spokesperson&#8217;s Office later retracted its accusation that reporters had misquoted the officer and issued a second statement claiming that the high-ranking officer had made a mistake and was wrong in claiming that Halutz had issued such a directive.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Maybe I should stop reading about Middle Eastern politics and read something <a href="http://www.artscroll.com/Books/ktah.html">cheerful and seasonal</a>.</p>
