<p>Narratives of transsexuality aimed at a general audience, both in print and online, are a genre unto themselves, and one of the conventions of the genre is the tone, directed at cissexual (i.e. non-trans) readers, of &#8220;please understand me, because if you understand me, then you couldn&#8217;t possibly condemn me&#8221;.  The refreshing thing about Julia Serano&#8217;s <a href="http://www.juliaserano.com/whippinggirl.html">Whipping Girl</a> is that it breaks that frame, and tells us &#8220;please understand <em>yourselves</em>, because if you understand the prejudices that our culture has taught you, then you can learn to respect me&#8221;.</p>

	<p>For example, consider the issue of &#8220;passing&#8221;, which consumes a lot of the literature devoted to transsexuality. (I have to include <a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/article/the-pink-and-blue-highlighters-in-your-brain">something I myself blogged five years ago</a> in this indictment.) Serano points out that the language of &#8220;passing&#8221; puts the focus on the trans person, who either succeeds or fails at &#8220;passing&#8221; as his or her self-identified gender. But it ignores the role of <em>other people</em> who pass judgement (ahem) on the people they encounter, and who stigmatize anyone whose gender presentation they consider deviant. (Gender-noncomformant cissexuals sometimes run afoul of this stigma<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/#fn3467870524a3dc1f1c9eed">1</a></sup>, but we don&#8217;t usually describe their experience as a failure to &#8220;pass&#8221;.) Taking for granted that everyone else will acknowledge your self-identified gender&#8212;assuming that if someone does misidentify your gender, then your peers will agree that the problem is with them, not you&#8212;is one aspect of what Serano calls &#8220;cissexual privilege&#8221;.</p>

	<p>With insights like this, Serano attacks the received wisdom of many communities: not just mainstream &#8220;straight&#8221; society and media, but also the medical establishment, the &#8220;queer studies&#8221; world (Foucault and his intellectual descendants), lesbian and queer communities, and the feminist world.</p>

	<p>With regard to feminism, she has critiques of the &#8220;feminism is all about the specialness of women, by which of course we mean women who have been raised as girls&#8221; faction of the movement (no surprise there), the &#8220;let&#8217;s measure feminist progress by how many women are becoming doctors and lawyers&#8221; faction, and the &#8220;let&#8217;s deconstruct the gender binary and live androgynously ever after&#8221; faction. But she comes not to undermine feminism, but to improve it.</p>

	<p>Serano&#8217;s model of sexism, I humbly suggest, is worth adding to the Feminism 101 curriculum. She distinguishes between <em>traditional</em> sexism, the belief that masculinity is superior to femininity, and <em>oppositional</em> sexism, the belief that men should be masculine and women should be feminine. A woman (i.e., someone universally regarded as female&#8212;let&#8217;s bracket the trans issues for a minute) who takes on a stereotypically female role benefits from oppositional sexism, but is harmed by traditional sexism.  A woman who goes into stereotypically male endeavors benefits from traditional sexism (e.g., higher pay and prestige) but is harmed by oppositional sexism. A &#8220;manly man&#8221; benefits from both, and an effeminate man is harmed by both.  This tension explains why trans women encounter <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-rowe/krxq-sacramento-radio-hos_b_210637.html">extreme reactions</a> and trans men are barely noticed by mainstream society, but it also explains a lot of other things about the way sexism operates in society, even among cis heterosexual men and women. (For instance, Serano observes that the modern feminist movement has done a lot to fight oppositional sexism but not so much to fight traditional sexism, and suggests that this is why many straight, cissexual, <em>femme</em> women will say &#8220;I&#8217;m not a feminist&#8221; even as they enjoy many of the rights that feminists have won for them.)</p>

	<p>Which is why this is a book that everyone should read, regardless of their gender, how masculine or feminine they are, their attitude towards transsexuality, or their attitude towards feminism itself.</p>
