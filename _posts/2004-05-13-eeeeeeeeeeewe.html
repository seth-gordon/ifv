<p>A week and a half ago, we went to <a href="http://www.goreplace.org/">Gore Place</a> to look at the animals, and we got to see a lamb being born. Fortunately, I brought my camera. <p>Warning: some readers, especially readers who have never seen a mammal give birth before, may find the following pictures disturbing.</p> <table> <tr> <td>Another newborn lamb was in the barn when we arrived, so we thought this was the placenta. It turned out to be the amniotic sac.</td> <td>&#8220;Did I look like that when I was having our baby?&#8221; &#8220;Well, our baby&#8217;s nose wasn&#8217;t as furry.&#8221; Look for the hooves, below the nose, inside the second lamb&#8217;s amniotic sac.</td> <td>Mama nuzzles her minutes-old lamb. The first one, in the foreground, hasn&#8217;t found Mama&#8217;s teats yet.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="center"><a href="http://dynamic.ropine.com/img/sheep/amnio.jpg" target="sheep"><img src="http://dynamic.ropine.com/img/sheep/amnio.jpg" width="100"></a></td> <td align="center"><a href="http://dynamic.ropine.com/img/sheep/nose.jpg" target="sheep"><img src="http://dynamic.ropine.com/img/sheep/nose.jpg" width="100"></a></td> <td align="center"><a href="http://dynamic.ropine.com/img/sheep/two.jpg" target="sheep"><img src="http://dynamic.ropine.com/img/sheep/two.jpg" width="100"></a></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="3">Oh, yeah, we had a cute toddler with us, too. Of course, we could never get him strategically positioned <em>close</em> to one of the animals for long enough to get a picture.</td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="3" align="center"><a href="http://dynamic.ropine.com/img/sheep/llama.jpg" target="sheep"><img src="http://dynamic.ropine.com/img/sheep/llama.jpg" width="240"></a></td> </tr> </table></p>
