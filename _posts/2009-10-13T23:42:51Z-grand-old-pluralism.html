<p>The Grand Old Party has a Grand New Web Site, which includes <a href="http://gop.com/index.php/learn/accomplishment/">a helpful graphics-rich page</a> listing the Republican Party&#8217;s noteworthy accomplishments.</p>

	<p>From this, you can learn that</p>

	<ul>
		<li>the Republicans in Congress emancipated all of the District of Columbia&#8217;s slaves in 1862</li>
		<li>the Republicans passed the 13th, 14th, 15th, and 19th Amendments to the Constitution</li>
		<li>the Republicans established the &#8220;Buffalo Soldiers&#8221;, six regiments of African-American troops</li>
		<li>the Republicans set up Howard University for the purpose of giving higher education to African-Americans</li>
		<li>Justice John Marshall Harlan, who dissented from <em>Plessy v. Ferguson</em>, was a Republican</li>
		<li>a former slave chaired the 1884 Republican National Convention</li>
		<li>the Republicans gave US citizenship to Native Americans</li>
		<li>the first Hispanic governor, the first African-American senator, the first Hispanic senator, the first Asian-American senator, and the first woman mayor were Republicans</li>
		<li>a Republican President appointed the first Jewish Cabinet secretary</li>
		<li>the Republican platform of 1940 called for integrating the armed forces</li>
		<li>the Republicans passed civil-rights laws in 1871, 1875, 1957, and 1960</li>
		<li>a Republican appeals-court judge ordered the University of Mississippi to admit its first African-American student</li>
		<li>a Republican President used the National Guard to integrate the Little Rock public schools</li>
		<li>a Republican Supreme Court justice wrote the opinion in <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em></li>
	</ul>

	<p>Reading that list, you&#8217;d think that for the first hundred years of its existence, the Republican Party did practically nothing to help white men.</p>
