<p>If you&#8217;ve been wondering where this blog has been for the past two months, the answer is simple: I spent Elul and Tishrei atoning for the sin of not backing up my server. Fortunately, I still had files on the machine that had been hosting this blog up until September&nbsp;2004, and a large number of the blog postings from the following year could be reconstructed from Bloglines and from search-engine caches. <p>A friend of mine has introduced me to <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/">Unison</a>, and my new server, God willing, is backed up daily and the backups are copied to an undisclosed location. There are some mistakes I <em>really</em> don&#8217;t want to make twice.</p></p>
