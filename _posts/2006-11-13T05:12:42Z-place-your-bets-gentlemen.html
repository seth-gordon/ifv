<p>Senator Joe Lieberman (Lieberman-CT), formerly Senator Joe Lieberman (D-CT), told <em>Meet the Press</em> that he was not ruling out the possibility of becoming Senator Joe Lieberman (R-CT), a move that would give the Senate back to the Republican Party.</p>
	<p>On the one hand, he owes a lot of Republican machers for the work they did helping him win this election. On the other hand, once the dust clears from his defection, he would probably get a lot less media attention as just another moderate Republican than he does now as a maverick Democrat.</p>
	<p>Who wants to lay odds?</p>
