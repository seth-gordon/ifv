<p>This country needs more children&#8217;s toys that help our young ones respect and empathize with people who have severe mobility impairments. I am disappointed to report that the <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=4308023">Dora the Explorer Lil&#8217; Quad</a> is not such a toy.</p>
