<p>When Jacob&#8217;s funeral procession crossed the Jordan River, his sons immediately began a seven-day period of eulogies and mourning for him (Genesis 50:10). The text goes on to say that the Canaanites &#8220;said, this is a solemn Egyptian grief; therefore, [the place] is called Grief of Egypt, over the Jordan River&#8221; (50:11). In Egypt, Jacob&#8217;s children had to be separated from the Egyptian population, because Egyptians hated shepherds (46:34). But upon entering Canaan, they&#8217;re treated as Egyptians. <p>I&#8217;m reminded of a complaint by some of the Soviet Jews who immigrated to Israel, back when there <em>was</em> a Soviet Union, and when applying for an exit visa marked a Soviet citizen as a traitor to the motherland: in the Soviet Union, they were Jews rather than Russians; in Israel, they were Russians rather than Israelis.</p></p>
