<p>Michelle Cottle <a href="http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=life&s=cottle061804">observes</a> that while liberals flame on and on about &#8220;hypocritical&#8221; acts by conservatives (Henry Hyde&#8217;s &#8220;youthful indiscretions,&#8221; Rush Limbaugh&#8217;s drug addition, William Bennett&#8217;s gambling habit, Jack Ryan&#8217;s taste for kinky sex clubs, and now Dick Cheney&#8217;s naughty language), conservatives themselves don&#8217;t seem particularly bothered by it. <p>I&#8217;ll agree that this focus on hypocrisy is a bad rhetorical strategy for liberals, but there is one area where conservatives perceive, and mercilessly lampoon, liberal hypocrisy: wealth. If you read all the snark about how rich Kerry and his wife are, or if you recall the outrage over Hillary Clinton making a killing in the commodities market, you&#8217;d think that it&#8217;s some kind of disgrace for a liberal to have large quantities of money. (I <em>assume</em> they consider this wealth to be some kind of hypocrisy, rather than a bad thing in and of itself; our Vice-President didn&#8217;t exactly spend the last twenty years as a Franciscan monk, and his fellow Republicans don&#8217;t hold his career against him.)</p> <p>But where&#8217;s the hypocrisy? Mere <em>possession</em> of wealth has never been a sin among liberals. Lefties have offered a number of justifications for raising the income taxes paid by the rich, but as far as I know, &#8220;let&#8217;s punish these guys for having so much money&#8221; has never been one of them. Heck, having money isn&#8217;t even a sin among Marxists&#8212;the literate ones, at least. <a href="http://www.imjustsayin.net/silverlake/kbknostalgia-textdocument.html">Karl and Fred</a> did not see the struggle of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie as a battle of Good versus Evil, but as the natural conclusion of an amoral historical process.</p> <p>Let the record show that if the good Lord sees fit to challenge me with great wealth, I will cheerfully pay every penny of tax that I owe, donate heaps of money to people who probably want my taxes to be even higher, <em>and</em> use whatever is left over to splurge on a bigger house, vacations on Cape Cod, a nice set of china and silverware, tasteful dress clothes, and whatever other creature comforts would not make my Yankee forebears blush. And if that prompts anyone to call me a white-wine-swilling liberal elitist, I can only respond, <i>&#8220;L&#8217;chayyim!&#8221;</i></p></p>
