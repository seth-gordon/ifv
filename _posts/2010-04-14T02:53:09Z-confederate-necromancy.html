<p>I hear that some politicians south of the Mason-Dixon line have proclaimed April to be “Confederate History Month”. The most eloquent commentary I have read on this subject comes from <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2010/04/the-ghost-of-bobby-lee/38813/">Ta-Nehisi Coates</a>:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>The Lost Cause is necromancy&#8212;it summons the dead and enslaves them to the need of their vainglorious, self-styled descendants. Its greatest crime is how it denies, even in death, the humanity of the very people it claims to venerate. This isn&#8217;t about &#8220;honoring&#8221; the past&#8212;it&#8217;s about an inability to cope with the present.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>As a bonus, for the benefit of those who are too sophisticated to believe that the Civil War was primarily a war over slavery, Coates provides choice excerpts from various states’ declarations of secession. Read, as they say, the rest.</p>
