<p>One reason I haven’t been blogging much recently is that I&#8217;ve been trying to spend more time working on my fiction writing.  I got so many helpful comments on <a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/article/married-white-man-creative-seeks-sadist">my last submission</a> that not only am I prepared to revise it and look for a publisher, but I wrote <em>something else</em>, and I am ready to share a draft of that something else with whoever is willing to send back a critique within a month or so.</p>

	<p>This time around I actually tracked how much time I was spending, usually working in sixty-minute blocks, so I can report that the process from outline to ready-for-beta draft took just under 31 hours.  Yeah, I can write forty thousand words in a month&#8230; and delete thirty-two thousand of those words.</p>

	<p>My newest dubious creation (total length: approx. 7,600 words) begins as follows:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>I promised you in the hospital that I would write you every day, and I’m sorry I missed a day, but last night I couldn’t find my computer.  I guess it would serve me right if boyscript becomes meaningless to you by the time this letter reaches you.  Just in case, though, I will write down as much as I can now, starting with when I arrived for my first day of high school.</p>
		<p>Getting into the building took longer than I expected, because each doorway had a teacher in front of it with a spool of rectangular lemon-yellow stickers.  Each boy got waved through the door.  Each girl had to present the teacher with her sheathed knife and get a sticker joining the handle to the scabbard.  I walked through, trying to pretend I had walked through lines like this for years, trying not to look at anyone’s weaponry.  The scar tingled on the back of my left hand.</p>
		<p>I followed the numbers painted on yellow wall tile until I came to 105, my homeroom, and only then did I notice the banner across the hallway.  Across the left side, blue paint on white paper, it said <i><span class="caps">WELCOME</span></i>.  Then, in red, sketched with the same width of brush, were a human figure with arms raised, a hand with two fingers making a V shape, and a round eye with the pupil looking to my left.  Person, hand, and eye were all drawn at the same height.</p>
		<p>I remembered seeing the same kind of script on Mom’s notepad this morning.  A row of gesticulating body parts had been stamped into her letterhead right next to <i>Elizabeth Yamamoto, M.D., Psy.D.</i>, and under that, she had pencilled in a dozen more, in the same style, and pinned the sheet to the fridge with a magnet.</p>
		<p>“What’s that?” I had asked.</p>
		<p>“Just a note to Consuela,” she had said.</p>
		<p>“A note for what?  Asking her to wash the mammoth hide after she sweeps out the cave?”</p>
		<p>Mom had given me a suspicious look and I had resolved to try really <em>really</em> hard to blend in.</p>
