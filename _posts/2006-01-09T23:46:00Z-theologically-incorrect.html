<blockquote>   <p>&#8220;Shall we accept pleasure from God, and not accept pain?&#8221;  &#8212;Job 2:10</p> </blockquote>  <p>A <a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/mtarchive/004143.html">Jew</a>, a <a href="http://slacktivist.typepad.com/slacktivist/2006/01/broken_news_and.html">Christian</a>, and an <a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/that_curious_religious_asymmetry/">atheist</a> on my blogroll have all grumbled about how the press throws around terms like &#8220;miracle&#8221; and &#8220;prayers answered&#8221; to describe good news, but avoids such language to describe bad news.  On the one hand, these reporters and headline-writers clearly endorse the idea that our mundane lives are influenced by divine force.  On the other hand, they don&#8217;t acknowledge that a single divine force is responsible for <em>everything</em> in our mundane lives, the sweet and the sour.</p>  <p>If our newspapers are going to be written by polytheists, the least they can do is be straightforward about it.  I would <em>kvell</em> to open up the <em>Boston Globe</em> and see headlines like these:</p>  <ul> <li>Nike Scorns Red Sox</li> <li>Dionysus Kills <span class="caps">MIT</span> Freshman</li> <li>Int&#8217;l Math Test: Athena Still Favors Japan</li> <li>For Years, Aphrodite Shielded Abusive Husband</li> <li>CO<sub>2</sub> Levels Higher; Apollo Fiercer</li> <li>New Quebec Autonomy Vote: Will <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toutatis">Toutatis</a> Prevail?</li> </ul>
