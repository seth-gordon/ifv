<p>Last year, it turned out that our MPs knew how to beat the crap out of prisoners in Abu Ghreib but <a href="http://dynamic.ropine.com/yo/politics/iraq/prison.html">had trouble keeping the prisoners from escaping</a>. <p>Now, we learn that the CIA agents who abducted Osama Moustafa Hassan Nasr from Italy <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-0512250380dec25,1,7824008.story?coll=chi-news-hed">left their cell phones turned on, then used those cell phones to call both the US consulate and their friends back home</a>&#8212;allowing the Italian police to identify them and reconstruct a minute-by-minute timetable of the abduction.</p> <blockquote>So amateurish was the Milan rendition that the Italian lawyer for Robert Seldon Lady, whom prosecutors identify as the former CIA chief in Milan, says Lady&#8217;s primary defense will be that he was too good a spy to have been involved with something so badly planned and carried out.</blockquote> <p>Yeah, <em>that</em> strategy never fails to impress the judge.</p> <p>Is there anyone left in the Directorate of Operations who (a)&nbsp;is competent, (b)&nbsp;has a job that doesn&#8217;t involve waterboarding, and&#169;&nbsp;hasn&#8217;t pissed off the Vice-President?</p></p>
