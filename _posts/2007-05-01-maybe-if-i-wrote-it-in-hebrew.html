<p>My wife, who is frum and supports the State of Israel but is in no way a &#8220;religious Zionist&#8221;, gets her dander up every time she sees a bumper sticker saying &#8220;The Bible Says the Land of Israel Belongs to the Jews&#8221; and such-like.  So I had an idea the other day for a bumper sticker:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p style="text-align:center;">GOD GAVE THE LAND OF ISRAEL TO<br />
<em>(insert current occupants here)</em></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>From a Torah point of view, I think this statement is unassailable. As Yeshiahu Leibowitz ztz&#8221;l pointed out, just as God took the land from the Canaanites and gave it to us (cf. Rashi s.v. Genesis 1:1), He took it from us and gave it to the Assyrians, took it from the Assyrians and gave it to the Persians, etc., etc.</p>
	<p>But from a &#8220;not getting our tires slashed in the parking lot next to the kosher grocery store&#8221; point of view, I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d want that sentiment on our car.</p>
