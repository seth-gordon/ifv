<p><em>(Scene: Oak Square, Brighton, in 90° heat)</em></p>
	<p>&#8220;Do you want me to push the stroller?&#8221;</p>
	<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s OK, I&#8217;ll push the stroller.&#8221;</p>
	<p>&#8220;But what will people think, seeing me just walking alongside my 8½-months-pregnant wife while she pushes a double stroller with two children?&#8221;</p>
	<p>&#8220;Do I <em>look</em> pregnant?&#8221;</p>
	<p>&#8220;No, that dress just makes you look fat.&#8221; </p>
