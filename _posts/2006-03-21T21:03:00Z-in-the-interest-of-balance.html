<p><a href="http://www.kingfeatures.com/features/comics/mallard/about.htm">Mallard Fillmore</a>, which the <em>Boston Globe</em> runs as part of its sinister plan to make conservatives look silly, devoted today&#8217;s and yesterday&#8217;s strips to praising &#8220;maverick conservative&#8221; Tom Coburn, M.D., Republican Senator from Oklahoma. After reading <a href="http://www.dkosopedia.com/wiki/Tom_Coburn">the Senator&#8217;s entry on dKosopedia</a>, I have to wonder what this man, out of all the Republicans in the Senate, has done to earn the cartoonist&#8217;s praise. Is it his remark that &#8220;if you have [silicone breast implants], you&#8217;re healthier than if you don&#8217;t&#8221;? Is it his claim that thanks to his medical training, he can tell whether or not a witness is lying at a Congressional hearing? Is it the resolution he sponsored congratulating Carrie Underwood for winning <em>American Idol</em>?</p>
