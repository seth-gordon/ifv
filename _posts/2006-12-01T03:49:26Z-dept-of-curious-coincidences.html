<p>I was browsing through some data that my company had acquired from our good friends at the <a href="http://www.nga.mil/portal/site/nga01/">National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency</a>, and came across a reference to some place in Iraq called &#8220;Ḩayy Sab`at `Ashar (17) Tammūz&#8221;. <em>What&#8217;s that?</em> I wondered. <em>A name left over from the days when the Jewish people, exiled in Babylon, had fresh memories of the destruction of Jerusalem?</em></p>
	<p>I asked an Iraqi co-worker to translate the name, and it turned out to be more prosaic: &#8220;Tammūz&#8221; is modern Arabic for &#8220;July&#8221;, and July 17th is the day that the Ba`ath party came to power in Iraq.</p>
	<p>If Aish ha-Torah wants to use this in their next round of <a href="http://www.discoveryproduction.com/">Discovery seminars</a>, I want royalties.</p>
