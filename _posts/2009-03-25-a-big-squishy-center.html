<p><a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1073550.html">According to the latest news from Israel</a>, the Labor Party has decided to join Likud in a coalition government. &#8220;680 of Labor Party central committee members voted in favor of joining the coalition, while 570 voted against. The voter turnout stood at 78 percent of the committee members.&#8221;</p>

	<p>By comparison, according to the Britannica, back when there was a <a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/129291/Communist-Party-of-the-Soviet-Union">Communist Party of the Soviet Union</a>, that party&#8217;s Central Committee had &#8220;300 or so members&#8221;. Wikipedia reports that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Committee_of_the_Communist_Party_of_China">the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China</a> is about the same size.</p>

	<p>I have complained about my synagogue&#8217;s oversized board of directors in the past, but clearly, when it comes to top-heavy management, we are pikers.</p>
