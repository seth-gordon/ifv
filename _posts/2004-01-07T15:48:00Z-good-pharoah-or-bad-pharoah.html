<p>Pharoah to Joseph and his brothers, in Genesis 45:20: &#8220;Don&#8217;t be concerned about your possessions [when you move down here], because you will have the bounty of all the land of Egypt.&#8221; <p>Me: &#8220;Very clever&#8212;by encouraging them to leave their possessions behind, Pharoah is making Jacob&#8217;s family more dependent on him.&#8221;</p> <p>My wife: &#8220;No, he&#8217;s giving them a chance to save face. They can say that they&#8217;re coming empty-handed at Pharoah&#8217;s request, and not because the famine has impoverished them.&#8221;</p> <p>The commentators in <i>Torat Chayyim</i>, at least, are silent on this question. What say ye?</p></p>
