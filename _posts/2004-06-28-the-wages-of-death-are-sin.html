<p>In the passage describing the laws of the red heifer, the procedure for burning the heifer and accumulating the ashes is referred to as a <i>chatat</i>, a sin-offering (Numbers 19:9); when describing how these ashes must be used on someone who has come in contact with a corpse, the related verb <i>yitchata</i> is used (19:12). Why? If, say, someone has a heart attack and dies in a house that you are visiting, the death isn&#8217;t <em>your</em> fault; where&#8217;s the sin? <p>For one answer to this, we can look at commentary on the sacrifices that a woman brings after giving birth. There, she is required to bring a dove as a <i>chatat</i> (Leviticus 12:6, 8). Again, we could ask, what&#8217;s the sin in having a baby? Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai explains: while she was in labor, the woman might have sworn never to have relations with her husband again (Niddah 31b), forgotten the oath, and then violated it.</p> <p>In a similar vein, the experience of being near a dead body, while not a sin in itself, puts someone at a much greater risk for it. Consider what happens in this parsha. Right after the laws of the red heifer are passed down, Miriam dies (Numbers 20:1). While the Torah records many deaths, this is the first one since the Exodus where a dead person is named and the death is <em>not</em> attributed to his or her misdeeds. Then, when the people grumble about not having water, the usual roles of Moses and God are reversed. Instead of God speaking of a harsh punishment and Moses begging for mercy, God simply tells Moses how to provide the people with water and Moses loses his temper at them (20:2&#8211;13). Because Moses could not stay focused on his duty in the aftermath of his sister&#8217;s death, he was denied admission into the Land of Israel.</p></p>
