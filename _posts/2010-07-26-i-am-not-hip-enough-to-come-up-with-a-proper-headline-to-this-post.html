<p>Shaul Magid,<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/#fn1479345554c4cee44a3277">1</a></sup> <a href="http://zeek.forward.com/articles/116880">reviewing</a> a sociological study of ArtScroll, remarks:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Indeed, the new Conservative Etz Hayyim is arguably a response to the Stone Chumash the way the Beach Boys “Pet Sounds”(1966) was a response to the Beatles’ “Rubber Soul” (1965).</p>

	<p class="fn" id="fn1479345554c4cee44a3277"><sup>1</sup> I recall meeting Rabbi Magid at <a href="http://michaelcarasik.com/">Michael Carasik</a>’s Shabbat table, and now that I know he writes all this stuff on the intarwebs, I will have to look for more of it.  Hey, <a href="http://zeek.forward.com/articles/116580/">look</a>: &#8220;Shaul Magid’s controversial thesis that American Judaism is dominated by three dogmas: pro-Israelism, the uniqueness of the Holocaust, and the war against intermarriage.&#8221; That&#8217;s <em>controversial</em>?</p>
