<p>In <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0092546/">Amazon Women on the Moon</a>, there&#8217;s a skit where a woman is about to invite her date into her apartment, but first she asks for a driver&#8217;s license and credit card. Moments later, her fax machine spits out a long list of her would-be lover&#8217;s past misdeeds, and after reading the report, she kicks him out. &#8220;<em>Three times</em>,&#8221; she cries, &#8220;you told a woman you loved her just so you could have sex with her!&#8221;</p>
	<p>That movie came out almost twenty years ago. These days, of course, you have more sophisticated ways of checking up on your dates. Which is all very well and good, until someone uses this technology to <a href="http://www.pittsburghcitypaper.ws/cover_story/index.cfm?type=Main%20Feature&#38;pagenum=4">falsely accuse a man of having herpes</a>.</p>
