Ms. Kaufman, who had a tummy tuck, works out avidly at a Bally&#8217;s gym, and she had a flock of friends in the crowd. Ms. Draizin, the high-school junior with the nose job, brought along her mother, her grandparents and six family friends.</p> <p>David Sarwer, a psychologist at the Center for Human Appearance at the University of Pennsylvania, which studies the human form and its impact on people&#8217;s lives, said the acceptance of plastic surgery went beyond mere vanity. &#8220;We&#8217;ve become increasingly accepting of ways of changing our bodies,&#8221; he said &#8220;We&#8217;re much more comfortable with our bodies as malleable.&#8221;</p> </blockquote> <p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2826933.stm">BBC:</a></p> <blockquote> <p>[R]esearch, carried out by Dutch scientists, found that there were almost three times the rate of suicides among women who had received breast implants compared with the population at large.</p> <p>They say that a desire for breast augmentation may, in some women, be a symptom of a far deeper insecurity and low self esteem which, in extreme cases, could trigger a suicide attempt.</p> </blockquote> <p class="via">BBC article via the <a href="http://www.othermag.org/index.php?p=13&c=1#comments">Othermag weblog</a></p></p>
