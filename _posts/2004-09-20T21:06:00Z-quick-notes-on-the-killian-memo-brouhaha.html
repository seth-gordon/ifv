<p>(For those of you who have been spending too much time engrossed in real life over the past two weeks: a couple of weeks ago, <cite>60 Minutes</cite> released memos that were purportedly written by Lt.&nbsp;Col.&nbsp;Jerry Killian, Dubya&#8217;s commanding officer when he was in the Texas Air National Guard. If they were genuine, the memos would have proven that Bush disobeyed a direct order to attend a flight physical, and they also would have documented that friends of the Bush family were pressuring Killian to give Bush a non-negative performance review. Various members of the <strike>101st</strike>101<sup>st</sup> Keyboard Brigade, not to mention <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/daily/graphics/cbsdocs_091804.html">rival news organizations</a>, suspected that the documents were not genuine, and <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/09/06/politics/main641481.shtml">CBS is now calling their broadcast a &#8220;mistake.&#8221;</a>) <ul> <li>Memo to my comrades in Blogovia: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&c2coff=1&as_qdr=all&q=killian+site%3Awww.dailykos.com&btnG=Search">don&#8217;t do Dan Rather&#8217;s homework for him</a>! By treating the allegations of forgery as Lies That Must Be Refuted, you just tied your own credibility to CBS&#8217;s, and look where you are now. If the memos <em>had been</em> genuine, CBS had as much information to refute the &#8220;fact-check their asses&#8221; crowd as you did, and a heck of a lot more.</li> <li>No, Virginia, the Killian-memo saga is not further proof of <a href="http://www.chrisnolan.com/archives/000535.html">the awesome power of the blogosphere</a>. Every hack in the Republican party had an incentive to discredit the memos; every competitor to CBS had an incentive to put egg on Dan Rather&#8217;s face. If blogs didn&#8217;t exist, you can be sure that critiques of the memos would have been pushed through the &#8220;mainstream&#8221; media.</li> <li>Given <a href="http://www.emergingdemocraticmajorityweblog.com/donkeyrising/archives/000662.php">the ineffectiveness of the &#8220;Swift Boat Veterans for Truth&#8221; ad campaign</a>, I have trouble believing that all this fuss over the Killian memos will harm Kerry&#8217;s chances of winning the election.</li> </ul></p>
