<p>I&#8217;ve been obsessing over the primaries all last week when I should have been reading the parshah, so rather than compose a drash about it, I&#8217;m going to borrow somebody else&#8217;s. The following is paraphrased from Rabbi Yehudah Schnall, one of my teachers at <a href="http://darchenoam.org/">Darche Noam</a>. He offers an answer to a question which commentators have argued about for centuries: if God &#8220;hardened Pharoah&#8217;s heart&#8221; to prevent him from liberating the Jews, how is this consistent with the doctrine that every person has free will? What is this &#8220;hardening the heart,&#8221; anyway? <p>Rabbi Schnall, who has a doctorate in philosophy, says that some philosophers distinguish between &#8220;first-order desires&#8221; and &#8220;second-order desires.&#8221; For example, an alcoholic may want to drink (first-order desire), but at the same time want to not want to drink (second-order desire). Generally speaking, when someone feels a conflict between a first-order and a second-order desire, he or she will identify himself or herself with the second-order desire. &#8220;I want to stop drinking, but I just can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p> <p>Now, consider Pharoah&#8217;s response to the plagues. Anyone in his position could see that the cost of the plagues&#8217; destruction outweighed any benefit from keeping the Jews enslaved, and be tempted to free the Jews for the greater good of the Egyptians. But if Pharoah didn&#8217;t believe that freeing the slaves was the <em>moral</em> thing to do, he would feel coerced into doing it, and he would wish he had the strength of character to tell Moses to take a hike. &#8220;I am the absolute ruler of the most powerful nation in the world,&#8221; he would think, &#8220;a deity in my own right, and these descendants of Jacob <em>deserve</em> to be my slaves. If I were a better Pharoah, I wouldn&#8217;t let myself sully the honor of Egypt by freeing six hundred thousand slaves just because my ex-courtier claims to be their god&#8217;s prophet and shows me a few magic tricks.&#8221;</p> <p>And so, the Eternal <em>gave</em> Pharoah enough willpower for that second-order desire to remain in control. At any time, Pharoah was free to recognize God&#8217;s moral sovereignty, free the Jews, and end the plagues. But he chose otherwise.</p></p>
