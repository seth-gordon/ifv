<p>The Lieutenant Governor of Tennessee, while responding to a constituent&#8217;s concern about a Muslim community center being built in Murfreesboro, remarked that while he is all in favor of freedom of religion, &#8220;you could even argue whether being a Muslim is actually a religion, or is it a nationality, way of life, cult, whatever you want to call it&#8221;. As others have already pointed out, this is free propaganda for al-Qaeda.</p>

	<p>I, for one, would like to highlight that word &#8220;cult&#8221;, because when used among evangelical Christians, it does not always mean &#8220;organization that brainwashes its members&#8221;. Sometimes it means &#8220;organization that preaches heresy&#8221;.</p>

	<p>Back when I was researching the Boston Church of Christ, I acquired a book by Walter Martin called <a href="http://www.waltermartin.com/cults.html">The Kingdom of the Cults</a>. Martin&#8217;s catalog of &#8220;cults&#8221; includes not only the Moonies and Scientology, but also Christian Science, Bahaâ€˜i, Buddhism, and Islam. In an appendix, he seriously examines the accusation that the Seventh-Day Adventists are a cult, but ultimately declares that they are legit. Judaism and Catholicism are not mentioned at all.</p>

	<p>Ask not, fellow unwashed heathen, for whom the wingnut trolls; it trolls for thee.</p>
