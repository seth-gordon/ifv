<p>Almost ten years ago, some of my friends were discussing what we should call this decade: the Oughts? the Naughts? “The Zeroes”, my wife said. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/28/opinion/28krugman.html?scp=1&amp;sq=krugman%20zero&amp;st=cse">As it turned out, she was prescient.</a></p>

	<p>Good-bye, Decade of Zeroes. Don’t let the door hit your Sylvester on the way out.</p>
