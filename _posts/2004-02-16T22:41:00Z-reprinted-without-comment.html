<p>Excerpt from <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2004/02/16/religion_losing_to_youth_sports_on_weekends/">&#8220;Religion losing to youth sports on weekends&#8221;</a> (link will rot), <cite>Boston Globe</cite>, 16 February 2004: <blockquote> <p>On a recent Sunday, Alice Gelwan, a resident of Manhattan&#8217;s Upper East Side, allowed her daughter to skip Hebrew school so she could take gymnastics lessons with a private teacher at Chelsea Piers Sports and Entertainment Complex, an 80,000-square-foot indoor arena in Manhattan.</p> <p>&#8220;This is much better,&#8221; said Gelwan, as she watched her daughter. &#8220;At Hebrew school, they give them a snack and go ramble about something that happened 500,000 years ago <i>[sic]</i>; but here, they are strengthening family ties, building friendships and self-esteem, and they know their parents are proud as can be.&#8221;</p> </blockquote></p>
