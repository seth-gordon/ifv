<p>Today I realized that a bug in a certain shell script, which involved the output of a <a href="http://www.linuxcommand.org/man_pages/sort1.html">sort</a> command being in almost but not quite the right order, could be fixed with the judicious use of <a href="http://www.linuxcommand.org/man_pages/ed1.html">ed</a>.</p>  <p>The scary thing is, this is the <em>second</em> time I&#8217;ve resorted to ed in my profession.  The first time was a few years ago, when I was trying to analyze some file that was too large to fit in <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html">Emacs</a>.</p>  <p>Remember, ladies and gentlemen, <a href="http://www.gnu.org/fun/jokes/ed.msg.html">ed is the standard text editor</a>. Accept no substitutes.</p>
