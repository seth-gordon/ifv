<p>Like all right-thinking (left-thinking?) people, I am shocked&#8212;<em>shocked!</em>&#8212;that the National Federation of Republican Women, at their Board of Directors&#8217; meeting in South Carolina, would show off people dressed like <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/tapped_archive?month=09&amp;year=2010&amp;base_name=posted_with_minimal_comment_1">this</a>. I mean&#8230; I mean&#8230; the event where these pictures were taken was advertised as &#8220;A Southern Experience&#8221;, and the president of the SC state Senate (the guy in the Confederate general&#8217;s uniform) <a href="http://www.fitsnews.com/2010/09/15/mcconnell-responds-to-slavery-pics/">praised</a> &#8220;the historical accuracy of the performers&#8221;, but that guy with the straw hat <em>isn&#8217;t holding the washboard correctly</em>!</p>
