<p>Even before <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/09/arts/music/09complaint.html?_r=1&amp;sq=complaints%20chorus&amp;st=cse&amp;scp=1&amp;pagewanted=all">the news hit the <i>New York Times</i></a>, you may have heard about “complaints choirs”, Finland’s incomparable gift to world culture. <a href="http://www.complaintschoir.org/choirs.html">Here</a> you can see videos of choirs that have gathered all over the world to sing their particular grievances: ninety-one singers in Helsinki, twenty-three in Hamburg, fifty-four in St. Petersburg, eighty in Canada, seventeen in Jerusalem—</p>

	<p>Wait a minute. <em>Seventeen?!</em></p>

	<p>Chevra, this is an <em>outrage</em>. I can forgive the Jerusalemites for not out-whining Russians and Finns, but to be bested by <em>Canadians</em><sup class="footnote"><a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/#fn1100122934b285c479defd">1</a></sup> (sorry, <a href="http://besamim.livejournal.com/">besamim</a>), chorusing about their cold feet and their ill-dressed Prime Minister, is an affront to the honor of the Jewish nation. <b>This must not stand.</b></p>

	<p>So if anyone is looking to assemble a Boston Jewish Community Complaints Choir, please count me in. Bonus points if you can find a catchy tune for “everyone on my right thinks I’m a heretic and everyone on my left thinks I’m a lunatic”.</p>

	<p class="fn" id="fn1100122934b285c479defd"><sup>1</sup> Among the English-language complaints choirs whose videos actually ran on my browser, I think the only one superior to the CBC’s production is the Chicago choir, which includes the quintessentially Chicagoan complaint “my dead grandma always votes for the wrong candidate”. </p>
