<p>Bruce C. Greenwald of Columbia University <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/14/business/14nocera.html?pagewanted=all">explains</a> why the rest of us can feel morally superior to those who were wiped out by Bernie Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>These were people with a fair amount of money, and most of them sought no professional advice. Itâ€™s like trying to do your own dentistry.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Umm, <em>hello?</em> These people <em>did</em> seek professional advice. They got it <strong>from a professional named Bernie Madoff</strong>.  The guy&#8217;s a former <span class="caps">NASDAQ</span> chairman, not some twenty-five-year-old operating out of a boiler room.</p>
