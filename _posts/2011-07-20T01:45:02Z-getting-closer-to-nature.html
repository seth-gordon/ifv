	<p>At some point while researching a story, I came across information on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_companion_plants">companion planting</a>. One of the suggestions from that page was that plants in the <i>Allium</i> family, including onions, are good to plant with fruit trees, because they deter pests. So when we had a couple of onion bulbs destined for the compost bin, I offered to plant them next to the apple trees in our yard.</p>

	<p>I don’t know if they are doing any good for the trees—given everything else in our yard, slugs and aphids are the least of their problems—but since I got to see what the flowering stem of an onion looks like, I can’t say the effort was wasted.</p>
