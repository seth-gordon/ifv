<p>We are now entering the season where normal American citizens, and not just wonks like myself, pay attention to the Presidential campaign, and <a href="http://www.electoral-vote.com/sep/sep09.html">the latest polls have Bush and Kerry pretty much tied</a>. <p>(The <cite>Time</cite> and <cite>Newsweek</cite> polls that gave Bush a double-digit lead appear to be outliers; see <a href="http://www.pollingreport.com/wh2004.htm">this summary of all the major national polls since the beginning of August</a>, and see <a href="http://www.emergingdemocraticmajorityweblog.com/donkeyrising/">Donkey Rising</a> for some commentary on poll methodology.)</p> <p>Of course, these polls are in the wake of the Republican convention, and people who say they&#8217;re &#8220;undecided&#8221; close to an election are more likely to vote for the challenger than for the incumbent. So for Bush to be <em>merely</em> tied with Kerry at this point doesn&#8217;t look so good for him.</p> <p>Still, it&#8217;s not a comfortable place for this Democrat to be, so I have found a few bucks to send to <a href="https://www.moveonpac.org/donate/switchad_winners.html">MoveOn PAC</a> (because their &#8220;Real People&#8221; ad campaign looks like it&#8217;s sending the right message to the right demographic group) and <a href="http://www.texansfortruth.com/index.html">Texans for Truth</a> (because dang it, if Bush&#8217;s supporters are going to spread around scurrilous lies about Kerry to impugn his character, I&#8217;m not above spreading the scurrilous truth about Bush for the same purpose).</p> <p>Let&#8217;s win this one for the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/09/national/09clinton.html?ex=1252382400&en=30bdb39a0f3948ad&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland">Clenis</a>!</p></p>
