<p>Today&#8217;s <cite>New York Times</cite> gives us the lowdown on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/11/fashion/thursdaystyles/11CRUSH.html?pagewanted=print" target="_blank" class="blines3" title="Link outside of this blog">girl crushes</a>. A girl crush, if you&#8217;re too lazy to read the article, is what happens when a straight woman has feelings of infatuation, completely nonsexual feelings, mind you, for another woman, and you shouldn&#8217;t think that she&#8217;s a lesbian for having these feelings. One of the women quoted in the article used the word &#8220;sexy&#8221; twice to describe her admiration for a colleague, but she must be regarding her co-worker as sexy in a strictly Platonic sense.</p> <p>What struck me about the article&#8212;aside from the author&#8217;s apparent hangups&#8212;was this line: &#8220;Social scientists suspect such emotions are part of women&#8217;s nature, feelings that evolution may have favored because they helped women bond with one another and work cooperatively.&#8221;</p> <blockquote> <p><i>Scene: Somewhere in Africa, 100,000 years ago. Two women are digging for yams.</i></p> <p><b>Uggah:</b> Hey, umm, Squeak, there&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve been meaning to tell you for a while.</p> <p><b>Squeak:</b> What?</p> <p><b>Uggah:</b> I just want you to know how much I really like you. When you were picking berries a few days ago, I was really impressed by how confident you were about which ones were ready to pick and which ones weren&#8217;t ripe, and I looked at how your fingers were holding the berries and&#8212;you know&#8212;like&#8212;I think you&#8217;re a really cool person and I want to be your friend.</p> <p><i>Pause.</i></p> <p><b>Squeak:</b> Uggah, that&#8217;s really sweet of you.</p> <p><b>Uggah:</b> I mean I want to be your friend in a totally non-sexual kind of way. I don&#8217;t want you to think I&#8217;m a dyke or anything.</p> <p><b>Squeak:</b> No, I don&#8217;t think that at all. I want to be your friend, too.</p> <p><i>Uggah smiles shyly and returns to her digging. Squeak looks out to the horizon and sees a band of mightily thewed single male hunters, dragging a carcass behind them.</i></p> <p><b>Squeak:</b> Hey, Ug? Can you do me a favor?</p> <p><b>Uggah:</b> Sure. What?</p> <p><b>Squeak:</b> It&#8217;s starting to get cold here. Can you run back to my hut and get a couple of blankets?</p> <p><b>Uggah:</b> I&#8217;d be glad to.</p> <p><b>Squeak:</b> I&#8217;d do it myself, but we&#8217;re so far from camp, and I have such a sore back from all this&#8212;</p> <p><b>Uggah:</b> It&#8217;s no problem. Really.</p> <p><i>Squeak watches Uggah until the other woman is a few hundred yards away. Then Squeak brushes back her hair, faces the approaching hunters, and watches them as she digs, leaning forward to show them her cleavage.</i></p> </blockquote> <p>Pop quiz for aspiring evolutionary psychologists: which character in this drama is going to leave more copies of her genome behind?</p> <p class="via">via <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/rm/510025.html" target="_blank" class="blines3" title="Link outside of this blog">rm</a></p>
