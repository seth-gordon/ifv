<p>We got a brochure in the mail for <a href="http://www.oorah.org/auction/2007/5_prize.htm">a Chinese auction</a> sponsored by Oorah. Two of the slots in the auction caught my eye:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.oorah.org/auction/2007/02-prize.htm">Eretz Yisroel</a>&#8212;round-trip airfare to Israel, seven-night hotel stay for two, and a one-week car rental.</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.oorah.org/auction/2007/25-prize.htm">Priceless Bracha</a>&#8212;round-trip airfare to Israel, seven-night hotel stay for two, and a blessing from a <em>Gadol</em>.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>I must therefore conclude that a <em>Gadol</em>&#8217;s blessing has a market value equivalent to a one-week Israeli car rental. Who knew?</p>
