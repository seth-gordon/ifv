<p>If you&#8217;re doing an inaugural party tomorrow, I recommend adding <a href="http://www.brunching.com/88lines.html">The Brunching Shuttlecocks&#8217; “88 Lines about 42 Presidents”</a> and <a href="http://www.jonathancoulton.com/2006/04/28/thing-a-week-30-the-presidents/">Jonathan Coulton&#8217;s “The Presidents”</a> to your playlist.</p>
