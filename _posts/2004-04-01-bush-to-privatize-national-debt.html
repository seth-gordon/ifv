<p>WASHINGTON, April 1 (<abbr title="April Fool's Press">AFP</abbr>)&#8212;President Bush unveiled a plan today to eliminate the entire national debt by distributing it to the American public. <p>In a Rose Garden speech this afternoon, he explained: &#8220;When I ran for President four years ago, I told the American people, you deserve a tax cut, because it&#8217;s your money, not the government&#8217;s money. Well, the same thing is true for the national debt. The debt belongs to you, not some bureaucrat in Washington, and you deserve control over how it gets paid back.&#8221;</p> <p>Under the plan, everyone who loaned money to the United States would have their debt transferred from the government to a randomly chosen private citizen. Since the current national debt is slightly over <a href="http://www.publicdebt.treas.gov/opd/opdpdodt.htm">four trillion dollars</a>, and the US population is about <a href="http://www.census.gov/main/www/popclock.html">300 million</a>, every American will be responsible for paying back about $14,000, and the federal government itself will be debt-free.</p> <p>When asked about people who can&#8217;t afford to make payments on a $14,000 debt, the President said, &#8220;That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important for Congress to authorize another round of tax cuts.&#8221;</p> <p class="via">see also Bush&#8217;s earlier plan to <a href="http://origin.www.johnkerry.com/features/april_fool.html">outsource the debt</a></p></p>
