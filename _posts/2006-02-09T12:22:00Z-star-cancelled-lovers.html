<p>The United States Postal Service <a href="http://www.usps.com/communications/news/press/2003/pr03_010.pdf">informs us</a> (PDF) that customers can send their Valentine&#8217;s Day cards to the postmaster at Romeo, MI&nbsp;48065 and get &#8220;a pictorial postmark illustrating Romeo and Juliette <em>[sic]</em> with the Romeo, MI cancellation&#8221;.</p>  <p><a href="http://redknight.livejournal.com/9176.html?style=mine">One postal customer in Malden, MA&nbsp;02148 responded:</a> &#8220;Don&#8217;t both Romeo and Juliet wind up killing themselves due to communications issues? Is this really the message we want to be sending to those nearest and dearest to our hearts?&#8221;</p>  <p>My wife pointed out that this would be an excellent way to send a letter to your in-laws.</p>
