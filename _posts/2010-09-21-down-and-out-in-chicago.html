This fellow is living so close to the financial edge that he fears that Obama&#8217;s proposed tax increase will have a catastrophic effect on his lifestyle, not to mention the lifestyles of his gardener and house cleaner.</p>

	<p>I want this man on my school&#8217;s financial-aid committee. Surely he will be able to see that <em>my</em> family is so down on its luck that we might as well be living in a cardboard box, and he will grant full scholarships to all our children. Then I will have enough income left over to hire a gardener.</p>
