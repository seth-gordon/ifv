<p>The Jacob of the last two parshiyot is the consummate deal-maker. He sells his birthright to Esau (25:33). Impersonating Esau, he tells his father, &#8220;eat my game, so that your soul will bless me&#8221; (27:19). His oath to God is conditional: &#8220;if the Eternal God will be with me, and guard me on this road &#8230;&#8221; (28:20&#8211;22). And of course, he offers his labor to Laban in exchange for Rachael (29:18, 27), and then agrees to work further in exchange for the striped and spotted sheep (30:32&#8211;33). Even his wives get into the contractual spirit, when Leah uses mandrakes to buy the right to sleep with Jacob from Rachael (30:15). <p>But here, when he reunites with Esau, he makes no deal: he gives lavish gifts and says it was only &#8220;to find favor in your eyes, sir&#8221; (33:8). What changed?</p> <p>Once Jacob returns to his father&#8217;s house, God has held His end of His conditional oath with Jacob. Jacob&#8217;s success in Laban&#8217;s household fulfills the blessing originally meant for Esau (27:28&#8211;29). With twelve sons, he can pass on the blessing of Abraham (28:3&#8211;4) &#8230; even if he, and eleven of those sons, meet untimely deaths. Jacob has received many blessings, but immortality is not among them.</p> <p>Jacob has nothing to offer God in exchange for a continuation of his good fortune. All he can say is &#8220;I have become small from all the kindness and truth that you have done for Your servant&#8221; (32:11). By realizing the significance of the gifts he received <em>from</em> God, he begins to appreciate the significance of the gifts he can give <em>to</em> his brother.</p></p>
