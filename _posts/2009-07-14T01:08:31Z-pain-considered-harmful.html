<p>I would have thought that the pain of unmedicated childbirth has very little in common with the pain of getting woken every three hours by a crying infant, not to mention the pain of one&#8217;s plans interrupted by a pre-schooler&#8217;s fourteenth tantrum of the day, not to mention&#8230; you get the idea. And therefore, I would have thought that suffering one of these pains does not really prepare you for the others, except perhaps through the psychology of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_costs">misaccounting for sunk costs</a>.</p>

	<p>But hey, what do I know?  I&#8217;m not <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2009/jul/12/pregnancy-pain-natural-birth-yoga">a university professor who is also one of the most influential midwives in Britain</a>.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>&#8220;A large number of women want to avoid pain. Some just don&#8217;t fancy the pain [of childbirth]. More women should be prepared to withstand pain,&#8221; he told the Observer. &#8220;Pain in labour is a purposeful, useful thing, which has quite a number of benefits, such as preparing a mother for the responsibility of nurturing a newborn baby.&#8221;</p>
		<p>&#8230;</p>
		<p>&#8220;Over recent decades there has been a loss of &#8216;rites of passage&#8217; meaning to childbirth, so that pain and stress are viewed negatively,&#8221; said Walsh. Patients should be told that labour pain is a timeless component of the &#8220;rites of passage&#8221; transition to motherhood, he added.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Snark aside, one can certainly make a case that in general, <em>anaesthetics are overused</em> in labor and that patients should weigh the risks against the benefits. But replacing a foolish orthodoxy (&#8220;the more medical interventions, the better&#8221;) with a foolish counter-orthodoxy (&#8220;if you take the epidural, you&#8217;re a bad mommy&#8221;) is not progress.</p>
