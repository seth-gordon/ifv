<p>Four years ago, the <em>Boston Globe</em> distinguished itself by its bombshell revelation that John Kerry (our junior senator; you may have heard of him) <em>wasn&#8217;t really Irish</em>.  Had Kerry ever claimed to be Irish?  Umm&#8230; no.  But a few people (reporters? aides?) could be found who had accidentally claimed that Kerry was Irish, and the senator <em>hadn&#8217;t corrected them</em>.</p>
	<p>Thank God we have newspapers like the <em>Globe</em> that stand ready to protect voters from such sinister fraud. Perhaps those crusading reporters will take an interest in <a href="http://store.barackobama.com/product_p/bt-patricks.htm">this</a>.</p>
	<p>Pandering or deception?  We report; you decide.</p>
