<p>The switchover from Speakeasy to Verizon DSL is, thank God and Shannon, complete.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, paragraph 3, clause (j), of Verizon&#8217;s Acceptable Use Policy states that I may not use their DSL service &#8220;to damage the name or reputation of Verizon, its parent, affiliates and subsidiaries, or any third parties&#8221;, so I don&#8217;t think I can tell the whole story of why this took so long until I&#8217;m back at work.</p>
