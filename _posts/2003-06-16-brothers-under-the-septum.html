<p>Erin Aubry Kaplan, a black essayist in <a href="http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2003/06/12/nosejobs/index_np.html">Salon</a>, reports with trepidation on a new study: &#8220;Rhinoplasty in the African-American Patient&#8221;. <blockquote>The lead author of the study, Dr. Rod Rohrich, chief of plastic surgery at the University of Texas in Dallas &#8230; sees plastic surgery not as a tool of black assimilation&#8212;that&#8217;s old school&#8212;but as a means of individualization, of sculpting each nose in proportion to each face to achieve what he calls &#8220;nasal-facial harmony&#8221;.</blockquote> Kaplan is unconvinced. As a member of another ethnic group with a reputation for nasal-facial disharmony, I can relate. She recalls <blockquote>tragic-mulatto potboiler novels from the late 19th century in which the secretly black heroine&#8217;s aquiline nose was like a talisman that always protected her from harm and preceded her in good fortune&#8230;</blockquote> and I recall the Dellwoods&#8217; song from my wife&#8217;s <cite>Dr. Demento</cite> tape: <blockquote>She got a nose job, she got a nose job<br />
 It&#8217;s all turned up where it was hanging down<br />
 She got a nose job, she got a nose job<br />
 And now she&#8217;s the prettiest gal in town&#8230;<br />
