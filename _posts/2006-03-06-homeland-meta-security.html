<p>Last night we saw <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0421239/">Red Eye</a>, an entertaining thriller about a hotel manager who becomes entangled in a plot to assassinate a deputy secretary of Homeland Security.</p>
	<p>Meanwhile, at <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060306/ap_on_go_co/homeland_insecurity">the real Department of Homeland Security</a>, former security guards report that the DHS headquarters are, well, insecure. The DHS contracts out (of course) its security to Wackenhut Services, which apparently is subcontracting the DHS account to Maxwell Smart.</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>For instance, when an envelope with suspicious powder was opened last fall at Homeland Security Department headquarters, guards said they watched in amazement as superiors carried it by the office of Secretary Michael Chertoff, took it outside and then shook it outside Chertoff&#8217;s window without evacuating people nearby.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Fortunately for Mr. Chertoff, Osama knows as well as I do that even if he knocked out all the top DHS managers in one bold and vicious attack, nobody would notice their absence.</p>
