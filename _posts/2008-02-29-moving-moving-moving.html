<p>If you see this posting, it&#8217;s a sign that I have sucessfully migrated this blog from my old Fedora 4 virtual server at <a href="http://openhosting.com/home">OpenHosting</a> to my new Debian Etch virtual server at <a href="http://www.linode.com/index.cfm">Linode</a>. (The OpenHosting guys have given me great service, but I&#8217;m tired of learning how many Linux software packages that I need are unavailable as <span class="caps">RPM</span>s.)</p>

	<p>As far as I can tell, the only glitch in the migration process was that a whole bunch of ” and ם characters were somehow corrupted. (Hell, to paraphrase Sartre, is other character sets.) But I think that&#8217;s fixed now.</p>
