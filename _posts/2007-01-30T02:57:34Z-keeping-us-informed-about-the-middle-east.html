<p>Does anyone else notice something, umm, <em>missing</em> from <a href="http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2007/01/28/ap3369293.html">this AP article about Israel&#8217;s first Muslim Cabinet minister</a>? Did the reporter and editor just have too much to drink that day, or something?</p>
	<p>(PS: on the general topic of Israeli Muslims in public service, see <a href="http://headheeb.blogmosis.com/archives/015125.html">the Head Heeb on Ali Yahya</a>, the first Arab to win the Israel prize and the former Israeli ambassador to Finland.)</p>
