<p>I do not have any fundamental objections to any of these newfangled reproductive technologies: <span class="caps">IVF</span>, surrogate parenthood, cloning, male pregnancy, whatever. Bring ’em on.  And I think progressive income taxes are better for society than sumptuary laws, which is to say, there&#8217;s nothing fundamentally wrong with being rich and there&#8217;s nothing fundamentally wrong with rich people buying things that regular folks can&#8217;t afford.</p>

	<p>But I was still squicked by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/30/magazine/30Surrogate-t.html?_r=1">this article on a woman whose fertilized egg was carried in another woman&#8217;s uterus</a>, starting with the layout of the magazine cover. While Cathy Hilling, the surrogate mother, stands in flats, Alex Kuczynski, producer of the lucky egg, stands in high heels <em>and</em> upstage <em>and</em> with her hair up. It seems that the <i>Times</i>’s art director wanted to portray the two women bonded at the hip, but also wanted to show clearly who is in charge.</p>

	<p>Deep in the text of the article, things get squickier:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>No money ever changes hands directly between the intended parents (I.P.’s in surrogacy speak) and the surrogate. All the money goes into an escrow account set up by Brisman’s office, and a third party pays out the monthly fees. I.P.’s and surrogates are discouraged from discussing money. This is partly to remove the air of commercialism from the proceedings.</p>
		<p>Shortly after our meeting, Brisman’s office started to send us profiles of potential surrogates. It felt strangely like getting a letter from the roommate who would be sharing your dorm room freshman year. They described themselves, their lives, their ambitions&#8230;.</p>
		<p>While no one volunteering to have our baby was poor, neither were they rich. The $25,000 we would pay would make a significant difference in their lives. Still, in our experience with the surrogacy industry, no one lingered on the topic of money. We encountered the wink-nod rule: Surrogates would never say they were motivated to carry a child for another couple just for money; they were all motivated by altruism. This gentle hypocrisy allows surrogacy to take place. Without it, both sides would have to acknowledge the deep cultural revulsion against attaching a dollar figure to the creation of a human life.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>I&#8217;m sure that when Hilling&#8217;s obstetrician negotiates with an insurance company over reimbursement rates, nobody has any qualms about &#8220;attaching a dollar figure to the creation of a human life&#8221;. And the insurance company doesn&#8217;t give a damn about the obstetrician&#8217;s life or ambitions.</p>

	<p>In a relationship between a contractor and her client, where money is discussed frankly and changes hands shamelessly, there can be mutual respect. <i>I have something you want; you have a skill I need; let&#8217;s discuss an arrangement that benefits us both.</i> Between two people who are related by blood or marriage, there can also be mutual respect. <i>I want you to do me a favor because we are in a bond of mutual obligation, and I understand that some day you may ask the same of me.</i> Hilling petitions for her assignment like a suitor, accepts Kuczynski&#8217;s money like a contractor, and then hangs out with her (playing Kuczynski&#8217;s piano, giving her a gift) like a relative. So what is their relationship? Ten years from now, if, God forbid, Hilling is abused by her husband or develops a drug habit, how far will Kuczynski et al. go to help out? Now that her skill as a gestator has been praised by the national newspaper of record, can Hilling demand $30,000 from the next aspiring mother? I fear that surrogates, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nanny-Diaries-Novel-Emma-Mclaughlin/dp/0312291639">nannies</a>, are ending up with the duties of both statuses and the privileges of neither.</p>
