<p>When Joseph Hanas was pled guilty to marijuana possession, the judge placed him in a special rehab program, run by a Pentecostal church. <a href="http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051206/METRO/512060440">The <i>Detroit News</i></a> tells what happened next: <blockquote> <p>Hanas said the program did not offer drug treatment or counseling, nor did it have any organized program other than reading the Bible and attending Pentecostal services.</p> <p>He said his rosary and prayer book was taken from him and his religion was denounced as &#8220;witchcraft.&#8221; Hanas said he was told his only chance of avoiding prison and a felony record was to convert to the Pentecostal faith.</p> </blockquote> <p>Hanas is suing to have his conviction set aside, and the <abbr title="American Civil Liberties Union"><span class="caps">ACLU</span></abbr> is helping him out.</p> <p>Since the plaintiff is a Catholic who is protesting a state-funded coercive conversion to a Protestant faith&#8212;they used to fight wars over this kind of thing&#8212;you might think that the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, <a href="http://www.catholicleague.org/faqs.htm">&#8220;the nation&#8217;s largest Catholic civil rights organization&#8221;</a>, would take an interest. Let&#8217;s see what the most recent stories on their <a href="http://www.catholicleague.org/news.htm">news page</a> are:</p> <ul> <li>Virgin Mary Defiled on &#8220;South Park&#8221;</li> <li>Lands&#8217; End Resolves Christmas Dispute</li> <li>No Christmas Trees Allowed</li> <li>Christmas Panic Hits Florida Atlantic Univ.</li> <li>Lands&#8217; End Neuters Christmas</li> <li>World <span class="caps">AIDS</span> Day and the Catholic Church</li> <li>Jews Say It&#8217;s OK to Celebrate Christmas</li> </ul> <p>People of faith who feel confined by the &#8220;wall of separation&#8221; between church and state should contemplate this case, and recall the warning in the voice of Sir Thomas More, patron saint of lawyers, in <i>A Man for All Seasons</i>:</p> <blockquote>This country is planted thick with laws from coast to coast, man&#8217;s laws not God&#8217;s, and if you cut them down&#8212;and you&#8217;re just the man to do it&#8212;do you really think that you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then? Yes, I&#8217;d give the devil the benefit of the law, for my own safety&#8217;s sake.</blockquote> <p class="via">via <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/jmhm/1509718.html?mode=reply">Sisyphus Shrugged</a> and <a href="http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/2005/12/in-defense-of-first-amendment.html">Lawyers, Guns, and Money</a></p></p>
