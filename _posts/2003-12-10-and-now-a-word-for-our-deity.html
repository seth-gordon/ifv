<p>(Sorry, again, for the delay in putting this up. It&#8217;s been one of those weeks &#8230; followed by one of those weekends &#8230; followed by one of those Mondays.) <p>In, umm, last week&#8217;s parsha, Jacob refers to God as the &#8220;<i>pachad</i> of Isaac&#8221; (Genesis 31:42, 31:53). King James, the new JPS translation, and Metsudah translate <i>pachad</i> as &#8220;fear,&#8221; Artscroll translates it as &#8220;Dread&#8221;, and the (Roman Catholic) New American Bible translates it as &#8220;Awesome One.&#8221; To get a sense of the nuances of this word, it helps to have a concordance. Here are some other places in Tanakh where the same root is used (all translations from the new JPS):</p> <ul> <li><i>Terror</i>, and pit, and trap / Upon you who dwell in Moab! &#8212;declares the Lord. (Jeremiah 48:43)</li> <li>I am bringing <i>terror</i> upon you &#8212;declares the Lord God of Hosts&#8212; / From all those around you. (Jeremiah 49:5)</li> <li>For what I <i>feared</i> has overtaken me; / What I dreaded has come upon me. (Job 3:25)</li> <li><i>Panic</i> and pitfall are our lot, / Death and destruction. (Lamentations 3:47)</li> <li>&#8230;And many of the people of the land professed to be Jews, for the <i>fear</i> of the Jews had fallen upon them. (Esther 8:11)</li> </ul> <p>From the various other places where the word is used, it doesn&#8217;t seem unreasonable to translate <i>pachad Yitzchak</i> as &#8220;the mind-numbing terror of Isaac&#8221;. Isaac is the only person who is paired with the word <i>pachad</i> in this way to refer to God. Of course, Isaac is the only person who came within a hair&#8217;s breadth of being sacrificed to God by his own father, so I suppose it&#8217;s understandable that his relationship with God, and nobody else&#8217;s, would be described in these terms.</p></p>
