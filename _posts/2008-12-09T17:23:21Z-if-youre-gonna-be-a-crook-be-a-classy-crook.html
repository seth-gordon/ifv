<p>Rod Blagojevich, the recently-arrested Governor of Illinois, may be <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/247380.php">“not as bright” as George W. Bush</a>, but if Ali Ata&#8217;s testimony is to be believed, even Blagojevich knows <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/national/10illinois_complaint.pdf">how to take a bribe</a>:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>[¶21] &#8230;After he arrived at Rezko’s offices, Ata was greeted by Rezko to whom he handed the check in an envelope. Rezko, carrying the check, ushered Ata into a conference room where he met with Rezko and <span class="caps">ROD</span> <span class="caps">BLAGOJEVICH</span>. Rezko placed the envelope containing Ata’s $25,000 check to <span class="caps">ROD</span> BLAGOJEVICH’s campaign on the conference room table between himself and <span class="caps">ROD</span> <span class="caps">BLAGOJEVICH</span>&#8230;</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>I hope that future corrupt politicians will follow the example of Governor Blagojevich and the legions of respectable graft-seekers who preceded him, instead of crassly <a href="http://bostonist.com/2008/10/28/wilkerson_brastuffing_photo_of_the.php">stuffing greenbacks into their undergarments</a>. </p>
