<p>Over this weekend I had one of those Learning Experiences that I could have done without.  It turns out that when you transfer your <em>domain registry</em> to a different registrar, the <em>information about your domain</em> does not automatically get copied over. So if you sent email over the past few days and it bounced, or if you tried to access this site over the last few days and got a 404 error or a mysterious domain-parking page, that&#8217;s why.</p>

	<p>I <strong>think</strong> everything is fixed now (except for the secondary MX record, which you don&#8217;t have to care about if you don&#8217;t know what it is, and maybe even if you do).</p>
