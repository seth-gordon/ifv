<p>[The following is based on a <i>tikkun leil Shavuot</i> talk that I gave at <a href="http://www.ktmshul.org">my synagogue</a> last week.]</p>

	<p class="mtb">There is a mishnah in the tractate <i>Nazir</i> that I first learned from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Big-Book-Jewish-Humor/dp/0061138134/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1244342142&amp;sr=8-1">The Big Book of Jewish Humor</a>, of all places:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p><img src="http://ropine.com/img/koi.png" style="float: right; width: 238px; height: 140px;" title="excerpt from Nazir 34a." alt="excerpt from Nazir 34a." /> Someone sees a koy [an animal that the rabbis were not sure whether to classify as wild or domesticated] and says
	<ol>
		<li>&#8220;I swear to be a nazirite [see Numbers 6:1-21] if this is a wild animal&#8221;; [others say]</li>
		<li>&#8220;I swear to be a nazirite if this is not a wild animal&#8221;;</li>
		<li>&#8220;I swear to be a nazirite if this is a domesticated animal&#8221;;</li>
		<li>&#8220;I swear to be a nazirite if this is not a domesticated animal&#8221;;</li>
		<li>&#8220;I swear to be a nazirite if this is both a wild animal and a domesticated animal&#8221;;</li>
		<li>&#8220;I swear to be a nazirite if this is neither a wild animal nor a domesticated animal&#8221;;</li>
		<li>&#8220;I swear to be a nazirite if one of you is a nazirite&#8221;;</li>
		<li>&#8220;I swear to be a nazirite if none of you is a nazirite&#8221;;</li>
		<li>&#8220;I swear to be a nazirite if all of you are nazirites&#8221;;</li>
	</ol></p>
		<p>the law is that they are all nazirites.</p>

	<p>But the rabbis, it turns out, may have the last laugh.</p>

	<p>If this mishnah sounds &#8220;illogical&#8221; to contemporary ears, it&#8217;s because to us, &#8220;logic&#8221; is a particular system of deduction that we learned in school, a tradition going back to Aristotle&#8212;what mathematicians call <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_logic"><em>classical</em> logic</a>.  But in the early twentieth century [isn&#8217;t it great to talk about &#8220;the twentieth century&#8221; as an era receding into history?], after classical logic had been reduced to axioms, some mathematicians began experimenting with other axioms, just as a chess master might entertain <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess960">alternative rule sets for chess</a>. One of these alternatives is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuitionistic_logic">intuitionistic logic</a>, which is just like classical logic except that it lacks <em>the law of the excluded middle</em>&#8212;the axiom that every proposition must be either true or false.</p>

	<p>(If you&#8217;re a geek who works with databases you may be familiar with &#8220;three-valued logic&#8221;, in which Boolean values may be true, false, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_(SQL)"><span class="caps">NULL</span></a>.  Intuitionistic logic is <em>not</em> three-valued logic. Nor is it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic">fuzzy logic</a>, in which a statement&#8217;s truthiness can be measured on a continuum from zero [totally false] to one [totally true]. The axioms of intuitionistic logic <em>neither</em> admit the law of the excluded middle <em>nor</em> define any third alternative to truth and falsehood.)</p>

	<p>Let us assume that if you make a conditional oath, the condition is <em>presumed to be true</em>, and if you want to wiggle out of the oath later, you have the burden of proving the condition false. So if P is some statement that can neither be proven nor disproven, &#8220;I am a nazirite if P&#8221; renders you a nazirite, and so does &#8220;I am a nazirite if not-P&#8221;. By that principle, the first six oath-takers are uncontroversially nazirites, and there are several ways, depending on your logic system, to prove that the seventh one is as well.</p>

	<p>By the time that we get to the eighth man, though, we have to consider what &#8220;I am a nazirite if none of you is a nazirite&#8221; means. If it means &#8220;I am a nazirite if <em>the law would not declare any of you to be nazirites</em>”, then the eighth man is off the hook, because, as we see, all seven of his predecessors end up nazirites. But since the halakhic judgement comes at the very <em>end</em> of the mishnah, maybe we are not allowed to interpret the eighth statement this way; perhaps, at the time the man took an oath, he had no idea what the law would declare, and therefore we cannot recursively apply the law&#8217;s judgement to interpret the validity of the oath.</p>

	<p>So alternatively, we could interpret it as &#8220;I am a nazirite if <em>none of the conditions that you imposed on your oaths are true</em>”. And in order to wriggle out of the oath, the eighth man would have to prove that <em>at least one</em> of those seven conditions are true. Under classical logic, this is easy: &#8220;either the koy is wild or not-wild, so either the first or the second condition is true, so hand over the Manishevitz&#8221;. But under intuitionistic logic, the eighth man is stuck: he <em>can&#8217;t</em> assume &#8220;either the koy is wild or not-wild&#8221;, so he has to prove <em>which</em> of his predecessors swore by a condition that turned out to be false, which he can&#8217;t do.</p>

	<p>For a reason that will become clear in the next paragraph, I think the mishnah considers &#8220;I am a nazirite if X, who swore another conditional oath, is also a nazirite&#8221; to have an ambiguous interpretation, and therefore considers both of the above possibilities and chooses the stricter one. Which is why the eighth man is also rendered a nazirite.</p>

	<p>Now let&#8217;s consider the ninth. If we interpret &#8220;I swear to be a nazirite if all of you are nazirites&#8221; as &#8220;I swear to be a nazirite if <em>the law would declare all of you to be nazirites</em>”&#8212;look, that&#8217;s exactly what the law does, and he&#8217;s stuck.  But if we interpret it as &#8220;I swear to be a nazirite if <em>all of the conditions that you imposed on your oaths are true</em>”, then he&#8217;s off the hook, because under both intuitionistic and classical logic, a statement cannot simultaneously be true <em>and</em> false, so the koy cannot be simultaneously wild <em>and</em> not-wild. But by the interpretive principle that I suggested in the last paragraph, the law interprets the ninth man&#8217;s statement conservatively, and he cannot use the axiom of non-contradition to escape.  Thus he, like his eight fellows, is a nazirite.</p>

	<p>(Note that none of the characters in our mishnah say &#8220;I swear to be a nazirite if this is a wild animal <em>and not a wild animal</em>.” Such a statement would not render you a nazirite, although it would earn you a flogging for the sin making a pointless oath.)</p>

	<p>And so, seen through the lens of intuitionistic logic, our mishnah is a little more reasonable, but, I hope, no less funny.</p>

	<p class="mtb">Is this common thread between second-century Jewish law and twentieth-century mathematics a mere coincidence?  I think not.</p>

	<p>The early intuitionists were not merely tweaking the rules of logic out of whimsy; they had an agenda. Classical mathematics assumes that &#8220;the truth is out there&#8221; and a mathematician&#8217;s job is to <em>discover</em> the timeless properties of some Platonic realm of numbers, triangles, and so on. The intuitionists believed that <em>the truth is in here</em> (he said, tapping his own forehead); mathematical objects are constructed in the mathematician&#8217;s mind, and you can only prove things about objects that you can construct.</p>

	<p>This attitude has a lot in common with halakhic decision-making. If you have a piece of meat that may or may not be kosher, at a certain point you may need to decide whether or not, in fact, you may eat the meat. If the meat&#8217;s status is confined to some ideal realm where all we can do is speculate &#8220;there exists in this slaughterhouse at least one side of beef such that&#8230;&#8221;, it does us no good. Jewish law gives us procedures by which, based on the incomplete information before us, we can <em>make a decision</em> one way or another. And by using these procedures, we are not merely <em>discovering</em> metaphysical facts about the physical world; instead, we <em>create</em> them.</p>
