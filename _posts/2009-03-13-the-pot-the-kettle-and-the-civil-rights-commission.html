<p>This past Shabbat, as I was bundling children up to leave our synagogue, I overheard some other members grumbling about a mosque that was being established in the Boston area&#8212;I forget where.  To be precise, they were grumbling that some other folks were concerned about a Mormon center being established in the area, whereas we all <em>should be</em> concerned about the mosque; we should hope that the Mormons go and proseletyze the Muslims.</p>

	<p>My observation that Muslims, unlike Mormons, are strict monotheists only prompted a recitation of anti-Muslim talking points, and I regret that I could not think on my feet fast enough to give each one the answer it deserved.</p>

	<p>In particular, to the complaint that the Koran advocates violence against unbelievers, I should have said: &#8220;Today is Shabbat Zachor. Less than two hours ago, we heard in the Haftarah about how King Saul lost his dynasty because he didn&#8217;t obey God&#8217;s command to kill every man, woman, and child in the nation of Amalek. Aren&#8217;t we in a <em>really bad position</em> to be judging other religions based on the plain text of their holy books?&#8221;</p>

	<p>Also, in response to &#8220;would you want a Muslim living next door to you?&#8221; I should have said &#8220;Have neighbors who follow a religion requiring them to <em>abstain from alcohol</em>? I would bake them a frigging <em>cake</em>. If there&#8217;s some <em>hadith</em> that also forbids pissing off a balcony, I would bake them <em>two cakes</em>.&#8221;</p>

	<p>I&#8217;m sure I will have other opportunities to practice such responses in the future, though. Unfortunately.</p>
