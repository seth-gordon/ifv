<p>Like many other progressives, I&#8217;ve been disappointed by the many instances of Obama seeming too eager to compromise with Republicans, more eager to appease his right flank than his left. One of the ways I temper my feelings is by remembering how disappointed I had been with Clinton.</p>

	<p>The military&#8217;s “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy is a case in point: <em>enacted</em> under Clinton, <em>repealed</em> under Obama.</p>

	<p>So, to the President and his party: Congratulations. And <em>more like this, dammit</em>.</p>
