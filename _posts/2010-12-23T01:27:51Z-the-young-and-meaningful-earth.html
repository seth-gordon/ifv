<p>Matthew Yglesias <a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/2010/12/the-case-for-young-earth-creationism/">proposes that we</a> &#8220;assume that God created the universe—fossils and all—to look <em>exactly like</em> that 4,000 years ago. That’s obviously a religious hypothesis rather than a scientific one, but it’s consistent with the evidence and doesn’t anyone to believe in a scientists’ conspiracy or anything.&#8221;</p>

	<p>This assumption is OK as far as philosophy goes, but it misses a crucial detail: if God did create the universe in this fashion, <em>why should I care?</em>  Young-Earth Creationism, at least in its American Christian incarnation, is not simply an allegation of facts about the universe. It casts the scientific view of the world&#8217;s origins as not merely incorrect but <em>evil</em>, because it implies a history of progress<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://ropine.com/yesh/#fn2650177764d12ae279ea6e">1</a></sup> without intervention from a personal God. By contrast, in this ideology, the earth is not merely six-thousand-ish years old, but bears a six-thousand-year history of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scalzi/1969980818/in/set-72157603091357751/">paradise, decline, and redemption</a>.</p>

	<p class="fn" id="fn2650177764d12ae279ea6e"><sup>1</sup> To see evolution as &#8220;progress&#8221; from &#8220;lower&#8221; to &#8220;higher&#8221; forms of life is a mistake going back to the Victorians, but young-earth creationists are not the only ones unclear on that concept. A co-worker of mine once reported hearing, from a certain world-famous linguist, that the syntax of natural languages must be optimal, because the human capacity for language is the product of evolution. &#8220;But&#8230; but&#8230;&#8221;, I sputtered, &#8220;evolution only tends to local&#8230; maxima&#8230;&#8221;  She rolled her eyes in sympathy.</p>
