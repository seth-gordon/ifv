<p>Excerpt from a footnote in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/04-473.ZD1.html">Justice Souter&#8217;s dissent from <em>Garcetti v. Ceballos</em></a>:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>[T]he Congress of the United States, by concurrent resolution, has previously expressly endorsed respect for a citizen’s obligations as the prime responsibility of Government employees: “Any person in Government Service should: … [p]ut loyalty to the highest moral principles and to country above loyalty to persons, party, or Government department,” and shall “[e]xpose corruption wherever discovered,” Code of Ethics for Government Service, H. Con. Res. 175, 85th Cong., 2d Sess., 72 Stat. B12. Display of this Code in Government buildings was once required by law, 94 Stat. <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/usc-cgi/get_external.cgi?type=statRef&amp;target=nonestatnum:94_855">855</a> ; <strong>this obligation has been repealed</strong>, Office of Government Ethics Authorization Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104–179, §4, 110 Stat. <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/usc-cgi/get_external.cgi?type=statRef&amp;target=nonestatnum:110_1566">1566</a>.</p>
