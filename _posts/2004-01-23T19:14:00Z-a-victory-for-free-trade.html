<p>The DVD Copy Control Association has finally <a href="http://www.eff.org/IP/Video/DVDCCA_case/20040122_eff_pr.php">admitted</a> that CSS, the encryption system built into DVD players, is not a trade secret, and therefore DeCSS, an open-source program that cracks the code, can be redistributed without any legal penalty. <p>Before the DVD CCA caved on this issue, you could only manufacture a DVD player with the studios&#8217; blessing if you signed a blood oath pledging that, in exchange for a license for the decryption system, you would frustrate your customers by:</p> <ol> <li>not exporting the unencrypted video stream in a digital form, and Macrovision-protecting any analog output from the player</li> <li>disabling the &#8220;fast-forward&#8221; and &#8220;menu&#8221; buttons for certain parts of the DVD, such as the ads that play when the disc is loaded</li> <li>enforcing the &#8220;region coding&#8221; system, so you can&#8217;t play cheap Indian DVDs, newly-released American DVDs, and obscure European DVDs on the same player</li> </ol> <p><em>Update:</em> According to <a href="http://zdnet.com.com/2100-1104_2-5145809.html">ZDNet</a>, the DVD CCA says they may file patent infringement suits to keep DeCSS underground. (First it&#8217;s a trade secret, now it&#8217;s patented. Neat trick, eh?)</p></p>
