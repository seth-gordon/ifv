<p>The authors of <i>Freakonomics</i>, pimping their next book, <a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/book_extracts/article6879237.ece">regale <em>Sunday Times</em> [UK] readers</a> with the heart-warming tale of Allie, a prostitute with a heart of gold and a Visa card to match. The authors mention the precautions she takes <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=7398011&amp;page=1&amp;page=1">to keep herself safe from her clients</a>, her frustration with keeping her occupation secret from her family and friends, and her realization that she had to move into a completely different career before she lost her looks. In the midst of all that, the authors declare:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>[T]he real puzzle isn’t why someone like Allie becomes a prostitute, but rather why more women don’t choose this career.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Jonathan Kulick <a href="http://www.samefacts.com/2009/10/economics/the-kind-of-girl-you-read-about-in-new-wave-magazines/">gives this the snark it richly deserves</a>:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>I look forward to reading the entire chapter, so I can find out why more men don’t choose to become high-end gay escorts.  It has to be much easier than waiting tables or accounting or laying pipe.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>I, personally, am puzzled as to why the Freakonomists are so puzzled by the choices of non-prostitute women, but treat the johns&#8217; motivation as self-evident. The vast majority of men who hire $500-an-hour prostitutes can also afford enough therapy and what-not to become attractive to the women who seek, ahem, noncommercial romantic relationships. If they&#8217;re not getting those relationships, well, that says something about their capabilities and priorities, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>

	<p>Personally, if I had to choose between waiting tables for $10 an hour and <em>pretending to love</em> creepy men for $500, I&#8217;d go for the tables.</p>
