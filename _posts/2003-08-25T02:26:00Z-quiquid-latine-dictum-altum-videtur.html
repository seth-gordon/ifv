<p>In the course of <a href="http://ou.org/torah/ti/5763/reeh63.htm">an otherwise interesting commentary</a> on last week&#8217;s parsha, Rabbi&nbsp;Avraham Fischer says: <blockquote>[Someone who feels very distant from God] must continue to pursue Hashem, to revere Him from the position of beholding the &#8220;mysterium tremendun&#8221; [sic] and to obey His commands.</blockquote> <p>Reading this, I wondered: why, in the course of a <i>d&#8217;var Torah</i> written for an Orthodox Jewish audience, does this rabbi use the language of the Roman Catholic Church?</p> <p>As far as I can tell from Google, &#8220;mysterium tremendum&#8221; was first used by Rudolph Otto, in his book <cite>The Idea of the Holy</cite> (1923), referring to God as a Wholly Other Being who inspires a numinous dread. The phrase also appears in an oft-quoted sentence from Martin Buber: &#8220;God is the mysterium tremendum that appears and overthrows, but he is also the mystery of the self-evident, nearer to me than my I.&#8221;</p> <p>OK, so I think I understand what he means now, and it&#8217;s not like &#8220;mysterium tremendum&#8221; is some term that the Vatican came up with that refers to the Trinity. But I am still left with two questions:</p> <ol> <li>Why should a person in this situation regard God specifically as the &#8220;mysterium tremendum?&#8221; Why not, say, the mystery of the self-evident? This issue probably deserves a page in and of itself, but instead the matter is just referred to in passing in the next-to-last paragraph of the drash.</li> <li>Why can&#8217;t R.&nbsp;Fischer just say what he means in plain Yiddish?</li> </ol></p>
