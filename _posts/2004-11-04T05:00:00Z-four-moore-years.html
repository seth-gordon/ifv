<p>As many of my comrades in Blogovia have observed, <a href="http://www.crookedtimber.org/archives/002798.html">the mainstream press&#8217;s obsession with &#8220;balance&#8221;</a> has made it hard for the reality-based community to get its message across. As Brad deLong quipped, if the Republicans say the world is flat and the Democrats say it&#8217;s round, the next day&#8217;s headline will read &#8220;Opinions On Shape Of Earth Differ.&#8221;</p> <p>So how <em>do</em> we get our message across? I regret that I cannot read the mind of the average swing-state voter. I can, however, read a graph.</p> <p><img src="http://ropine.com/img/history_12oct.jpg" align="middle" width="315"></p> <p><a href="http://www.fahrenheit911.com/">Fahrenheit 9/11</a> was the summer movie that mainstream political journalists loved to hate. It was shamelessly partisan; it indulged in cheap shots; it insinuated all sorts of things that could not be proven. It is also the top-grossing documentary in history; it was endorsed by NASCAR champion Dale Ernhardt, Jr.; its release correlates, as you see above, with a 25-point jump in Kerry&#8217;s expected electoral votes. Moore didn&#8217;t beg the networks to give him equal time on the news, or whine about how his side was not fairly represented on the news; he <em>created news</em>.</p> <p>I have my reservations about Moore as a journalist, but as a communications strategy for the left, the documentary looks damn promising.</p> <p>(Note to self: <a href="http://www.thehuntingofthepresident.com/">The Hunting of the President</a> is out on DVD now. Must see.)</p> <p>I would love to see a documentary about Republican vote manipulation in 2004: how Congress established a commission to set voting-machine standards and then didn&#8217;t give it the money to do its job; how Republican front organizations conducted voter-registration drives and threw out Democrats&#8217; registration papers; how easy it is to tamper with electronic voting machines that leave no paper trail; how challenges were used as a deliberate strategy to discourage voting in heavily Democratic districts. Heck, as a bonus, I&#8217;d like to see it mention William Rehnquist&#8217;s participation in the &#8220;Operation Eagle Eye&#8221; voter intimidation project, way back before he was a Justice of the United States Supreme Court.</p> <p>I don&#8217;t want a documentary that tells its audience, &#8220;Republicans stole the 2004 election.&#8221; (I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s true, and even if it is, it&#8217;s hard to make the case without seeming like a sore loser.) I want a documentary that tells its audience, &#8220;Republicans use fraud to prevent Democrats&#8217; votes from being counted.&#8221; I want such a documentary to tell such a compelling and unimpeachable story that the voters who believed Dubya&#8217;s promise to &#8220;bring honor and integrity back to the White House&#8221; will watch it, and think about it, and tell their friends&#8230;and when the Democrats complain of Republican dirty tricks in 2006 and 2008, those voters will think some more about which party stands for &#8220;moral values.&#8221;</p> <p>I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m not the only person with this idea, either.</p>
