<p>Some artist with his finger on the pulse of American taste has made <a href="http://www.caplakesting.com/2006_catalog/de/index.htm">a sculpture of Britney Spears, nude, giving birth</a> (NVSFW)&#8212;a sculpture which &#8220;reveals the crowning of baby Sean’s head&#8221; and &#8220;also acknowledges the pop-diva’s pin-up past by showing Spears seductively posed on all fours atop a bearskin rug with back arched, pelvis thrust upward, as she clutches the bear’s ears&#8230;&#8221;</p>
	<p>Free advice to any pregnant women out there who might take a statue of Ms. Spears as a role model: in the early stages of labor, if your baby is <a href="http://webcenter.health.webmd.netscape.com/NR/rdonlyres/8230169D-F910-4B89-BE8C-C6E482D28309.gif">sunny-side up</a>, this posture can make you more comfortable and maybe convince the kid to roll over.  Once the baby is ready to come out, all-fours can be a good position to push from, but <em>not</em> with your pelvis in the air like a bitch in heat. Unless, of course, you are enjoying the contractions so much that you want to push the baby <em>against</em> the force of gravity.</p>
	<p>P.S.: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_spears#2004.E2.80.932005:_Career_hiatus_and_family">According to Wikipedia</a>, the actual Spears baby was delivered by an elective C-section.</p>
